It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps, it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps, as if trying to hurry up.

My girlfriend and i decided to go to Alexander Springs camping for the weekend. We were living in Ormond Beach, Florida  approx. one hour from Alexander Springs. This was a spur of the moment idea that friday afternoon. We rushed around to pack our 4 man tent, lawn chairs, coolers and get groceries for the weekend and a case of oysters. We headed for the springs and we were in a hurry to get there in plenty of time of daylight so we could set up our tent. By the time we got our tent set up it was turning to dusk. We realized we had forgotten to buy firewood so we went into town to purchase a load of wood that would fill the trunk of the car. By the time we got back it was dark. The campground had some lighting for safety purposes I guess incase one had to walk to the bathroom, shower facillities. We started a fire and we also began cooking steaks on the grill and eating oysters and other snacks. We had plenty of food to last the weekend packed in our cooler. We ate our food, cooked on the grill then played cards till about 3:00am. We decided to quit and go to sleep so we could get up early to check out the sights. My girlfriend fell asleep right away and I layed there for about a half hour with a headache and coudn't go to sleep. I was listening to what sounded for sure like raccoons chattering around our site, figured they may be looking for crumbs. Suddenly the noise of raccoons stopped and everything was silent. I thought it was strange such a sudden silence and I smelled what semed to be the sent of a skunk. I thought that was strange because i had been living in Florida 20 years and never smelled a skunk. I thought there were no skunks in Florida. I sat up thinking i would go outside the tent and see what was going on, when i looked to my right i saw a shadow cast on the tent from the lighting in the campground, what looked to be like a man and my first thought was,\\\"surely no other campers would take our food in the night.\\\" It made a noise that i questioned was a bear but didn't sound like any bear noise I had ever heard and I'm originally from upper Michigan near the Great Lakes very remote area with alot of bears and had seen and heard many in my life. Then i got to thinking this figure was standing up and not on all fours and was so tall I thought it couldn't have been a man stealing our food. There were not many campers on the grounds that night either. At first I was approaching the door of the tent to go out and investigate when i heard the strange noise again. It sounded like a grunt noise. I did not feel this was a bear but couldn't imagine what it was, I was somewhat frozen in fear for a minute. Then I started talking to my girlfriend  trying to wake her up and she was scared. We only had one small flashlight and no weapons as we sat there stating we wish we had a gun,  so i did not go outside of the tent, but could not go to sleep that night. The next morning at early daylight we came out of the tent to find a mess. Our coolers had been ransacked, most food gone. I attributed this to the raccoons but realized they were not there long enough to make such a mess i didn't think. So we just laughed about it most of the day and joked about Bigfoot but never did we actually think that was what may have been outside of our tent and eating our food, We had to go in to town for more groceries that day. Late that night things felt strange and it had been lightly raining all day, to a heavier rain by nightime. we sat in the tent playing cards talking about this thing i saw outside the tent. We decided to get out quick, packed our stuff up and even left the tent. At work a couple days later i asked a friend at work who had been there the week before camping if she had ever seen any bear there and she said yes. But when i told her what i saw she said it sounded too weird. It took a few days before i unpacked the car and then realized we had left behind the tent. I called the Ranger at Alexander Springs and told them we had left our tent. They stated they wondered what had happened to us. We told them to keep the tent or dispose of it. They said they could store it for us till we came back again. We told them we didn't think we would be back anytime soon to go ahead and do what ever they wanted to with it.  We did not tell them of our experience and I never told anyone because i thought they would think I was crazy. When I came across this site i was hesitant to report it but my girlfriend has encouraged me too. I know that what i saw was not a bear and way to tall to be a man or even a tall man.\", \"location_details\": \"West on st road 40, just past Astor, turn off to the left on 19, it is in the East side of the Ocala Nat.

It was October '04 between 9-9:30pm, heading south about 3/4 of the way to Springfield Il. after passing the interchange to go to Lincoln, not sure which county. There weren't many cars on the road. We were in the left lane, I was the passenger. At the very far edge of the high beams I saw what looked like one of those big black 50 gallon lawn bags sitting with a bunch of garbage right off the side of the road between where the pavement meets the grass. It looked like someone had dumped trash... I was wrong! Grant you this all took place in like 8-9 seconds. As we got closer I saw the garbage was fast food bags and the black garbage bag had arms and a head! When we were maybe 5-6 car lengths away it swung its arms out in front of it and shot straight up, taking a small step backwards. My friend and I both said 'what the hell is that?' As he slowed down a little. In the split seconds it was full on in the head lights standing I saw a medium build, not massive at all, but thick, hair was 4-6\\\" and flat black in color with just a little bluish silver reflection from the headlights and the face was a lighter shade than the hair like charcoal grey, I don't recall seeing breasts and the hair seemed thinner and shorter on its front. Facial features at that speed were impossible to make out, but its chin seemed to jut out from where the collar bone area would be on a human. My friend owned a Mitsubishi Montero at that time. It rode about as high as the smaller big pick up trucks do. I'm 6'4\\\" and I had to step up slightly to get into the seat, and as we passed it close up, in the windshield and out the drivers side window its waist was as high as the top of the hood, probably 4 1/2 feet, and the rest was at least that much.

I was around 13 years old and my best friend was 12.  We had been badgering our parents for walkie-talkies for a couple years because we used to play in the woods so often.  Much to our delight, my friend's father was cleaning out their attic and found a set left by the previous owners of the house.  He cleaned them up, got us new batteries and we were on our way. There were very few houses in our area at the time and plenty of wooded areas to play.  We headed down to where a new road was being cut.  The crews had basically ploughed a rough dirt \\\"road\\\" almost 1/2 a mile into the dense forest off of our road.  We got almost to the end when we headed back into the woods (west).  We started heading toward the direction of an old quarry that had been abandoned for many years.  We had gone in about 100 yards when we agreed to start walking in opposite directions, but parallel to the \\\"road\\\", so we could test the range on the walkie-talkies. We were alternating our responses for about 40-50 yards when my friend stopped responding.  I could still see him in the breaks of the foliage, so after several attempts to reach him via the walkie-talkies, I just called out to him.  He came back across the radio and told me not to shout or move.  I asked him what was happening and he told me to be very still because he saw something behind a large tree that had fallen about another 40 yards further in.  It had just stormed about a week earlier and many trees in the woods had fallen.  This particular tree had its roots exposed, but was still suspended, on the \\\"leaf-end\\\", about 3-5 feet above the ground due to a tangle of vines.  He said that he could \\\"feel\\\" the \\\"something\\\" watching him and he was scared to move.  I told him that I didn't see anything and I would walk towards him.  He warned me again not to move and said that the \\\"thing\\\" was shifting its weight and started moving toward \\\"my end\\\" of the tree.  I stood there looking at the root disk and suddenly saw what appeared to be a dark face and broad shoulders.  I too could \\\"feel\\\" this \\\"thing\\\" watching me.  The creature, if you will, moved back and forth as if studying my friend and me.  The height was undiscernable, but had to be above six feet tall.  It was hard to see the legs, but those also appeared to be dark in colour.  After about 5 minutes of this \\\"thing\\\" alternating vantage points, I had enough and was ready to make a dash for the road.  My friend reluctantly agreed to move toward the spot we started while keeping an eye on the fallen tree.  We finally met up and began to back up.  We had only gotten a few yards when we saw the creature rise up and put its hands on the trunk by the root-disk.  My friend and I screamed at full volume and started to run for the \\\"road\\\".  We turned only once after hearing a loud crack of wood, possibly a branch or something underfoot, to see this creature running almost noiselessly in the opposite direction.  It, again, was very difficult to see, but appeared to be completely black, powerfully built and running on two legs.  We ran all the back home and said we would keep this incident between us.  A few days later, my friend's father said he had read an article in the Geauga Times Leader (a local paper) stating a woman in a nearby town had seen a Sasquatch.  We asked what a \\\"Sasquatch\\\" was and his dad laughed, saying it was a cross between an ape and a man and it wasn't real.  We read the article and it sounded exactly like what we had seen!  My friend's older brother said that he had heard something following him along the Chagrin River as he was going to a friend's house a week before and joked that it might have been the same thing as what was reported in the newspaper article.  I never spoke of this incident until I was into my adulthood and had moved out of the area.

The back 10 acres was heavily forested with thick underbrush. I could hear something very large moving through the thick underbrush and downed alder trees. Large branches were breaking like twigs.

There was no response, just the same noises happening. I did not want to walk into the swamp at that point.  I listened for about 10-15 minutes.

She said if it was what I said it was she didn't want to go outside. We stayed in the house the rest of the night and I was not scared but very tingly on my skin and alert. The next day i walked into the swamp to try to see evidence of the creature. I didn't make it very far because of the mud up to my knees and thick russian thistles. My friend came over later that day around dusk. I told him of the encounter and he asked where it had happened. I walked him to the location. When we arrived the same thing happened as the day before. The creature was still there and I was just down in the swamp a few hours earlier and heard nothing. My friend listened for about five minutes. I asked him what he thought it was. he replied,\\\"I don't know Chuck-but good luck\\\". Then he hurried to his car and jumped in and left just leaving me standing there with this thing roaring. I went inside the house with it still there. I didn't feel like shooting it. It didn't pound on the house or anything like that. I never heard it again after that. I sold the 20 acres and the two houses within 6 months after the incident.

They live in southern Indiana in a remote area. They own about 60 acres that was my grandmothers. The area is rolling hills some big enough to be considered mountains. It lies northwest of Louisville, KY and east of Paoli Peaks, IN, a fairly well known ski resort town. I often wondered about the things they say they have seen and heard in the woods. They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also. the woods is heavy with alot of undergrowth and alot of sink holes and caves. Houses are spaced out in the area with alot of other heavily wooded properties joining theirs. Years ago my grandmother didn't know what to call it but she reported to us of being chased back the lane by 2 adults - a larger adult and a smaller adult and 2 young ones. My siblings have heard howls but not really seen anything. My brother was killed in an automobile accident on Memorial day and we went up to help them make funeral arrangements on May 30th 06. I was on my way to the truck, it was probably between 11pm and midnight, my kids and husband were already in the truck we all had colds and my son was caughing so he my daughter and my husband did not hear it. It was a howl that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I am a country girl, I've heard a coyote, dog and wolf howel before and this wasn't any of those. I listened to the howls on your website and that is exactly what I heard only this one was alittle higher pitched like it may have been a younger one. My husband said all he could hear was my son coughing, I didn't want to be the only one who heard it. I told my sister the next day and she said yes I've heard it many times before. You don't have to prove to me that they exist I just want to know if that is what is in their woods. I am concerned for my parents safety.

We approached an intersection with no stop signs.  We actually stopped to look at a map.  All of a sudden, a very tall figure crossed right in front of our car.  We were shocked!  It must have been at least 7ft.+ tall, long arms, hairy body, ape-like appearance, very slender.  It walked completely upright and just crossed over to the other side of the road.  There was another car that approached this small intersection--that car also saw it, because he stopped the car--remember, this was a back road with no stop sign.  Shortly after we had seen this creature, there was an article in the local newspaper about sightings in the state of PA.  I cut out the article and saved it, placing it in a book for safe keeping.

I stopped by the park on my way home to try out some new camping equipment.  There are two entrances to the park; the main entrance off of Hwy 16 and the one I like because it's more wooded off of Applewhite Rd. Some new trails are being made because of some flooding that occurred in the area last year so there are some trees that have been cut down. One of these trails has a wooden fence with a \\\"No Trespassing\\\" sign on it. I ignored the sign and made my way to the river. I made a small fire and began fishing. While I was fishing I started to hear loud banging. I turned around to see if i could see what was making the noise but saw no one. We do have Woodpeckers but this was no woodpecker. I thought nothing of it and continued fishing. A few minutes went by and I heard a loud moan. Like a wail. Again, I turned to look around and saw no one. I started thinking, \\\"Okay, someone has got to be messing with me.\\\" I kept on fishing when out of the corner of my eye something moved and I heard a very loud splash. I did not see what was thrown into the water near me but it was big. A big rock or log is my guess. It made a giant \\\"SPLOOSH\\\". Something threw a BIG something in the water. After that I packed up and made my way back up to the trail. On my way back I heard the wood knocking again and I attempted to reply. I followed the three knocks I heard with three of my own. No reply. The whole time I walked back to my truck I had the feeling I was being watched. I stopped and looked around but saw no one. If someone was there they were well hidden and light on their feet because I didn't even hear footsteps. The area is wooded and there are leaves and branches everywhere so I'm sure I would have heard twigs snapping or leaves rustling if someone was there. When I got back to my truck I saw a jogger and his Lab going for a drink from the broken water fountain. I offered the man some bottled water for him and his dog. He thanked me and I took the opportunity to ask him if he had heard the same knocking or banging I had. He had. He said he and his dog stopped to listen but couldn't figure out where it was coming from. The road/highway divides the park. This man was on one side and I was on the other. This part of the highway doesn't get a lot of traffic so it wasn't traffic I heard. One more thing I think you should know is that this area has a legend called The Donkey Lady. All teenagers in San Antonio know of this legend. It is said if you cross her bridge you will hear her \\\"hooves\\\" pounding the road and things will be thrown at you. This legend has been around for many many years. After what happened yesterday,  I'm starting to think Donkey Lady Bridge isn't haunted by a ghost but occupied by something real. I'm not convinced Bigfoot exists because I need to see it but my wife believes and she suggested I report it to you guys. We often go hiking on these trails with our children and she likes to point out, facetiously, Bigfoot nests and food sources. We are an outdoorsy family and we live in the country where at night we hear owls and coyotes and know what predators and their prey live in our area and what noises they make.

It had been a long winter and it was the first time since he had broken his hip during the ice storm that he felt like being out in nature. My dad was very comfortable in the woods and on the water for he spent all his free time there. He had lived in this area all his life. Later that evening around 9 pm my mother called she was worried that my dad hadn\\u2019t come home yet. It was not unusual for him to stay out late in the woods or on the water, on numerous occasions in the past, I have had to go find him to tell him supper\\u2019s ready to get him home, but on this night I to had a bad feeling about him not being home yet. I got one of my friends to go with me to look for him. It was windy and dark so we took our flashlights and headed out. Dad\\u2019s favorite fishing spot was about a mile off of the highway right before Cypress Creek dumped into the Forked Deer River. The only way there is by boat or to hike. We went down the east side of the creek, shinning our flashlights and yelling for my dad. As we approached the area where my dad like to fish we heard a clicking sound like an insect, but not like any insect I had ever heard. So we stopped and looked around when we spotted on the North bank of the Forked Deer River two sets of large red eyes. This, of course, freaked us out. We started flashing the lights around and we spotted the boat on the other side of the creek but it was too deep and wide to cross so we had no choice but to go back to the highway and cross on the road and run back down the other side of the creek back to the boat. As we got back to the road my mother had called one of our cousins to help look for my dad. We told him we found him to go back to the house and call Rescue to meet us at the bridge. So we proceeded to run back down the west side of the creek to the spot the boat was. We found my dad floating beside the boat with the boat rope wrapped around his hand. The red eyes were still on the North bank of the Forked Deer River, as if they were keeping watch on my Dad. We were able to get him in the boat and perform CPR but unfortunately he had already died. So, of course, we were in a heighten state of emotions but we were trying to get my dad back to the Rescue unit waiting at the bridge on the highway. As we started paddling we were hitting something under the water but that couldn\\u2019t be that for the creek was about 20 ft deep.  We didn\\u2019t know or understand how or who had taken my dad\\u2019s life and it was as if they were after us as well. I kept yelling, \\u201cCome on you SOB, you got him but you\\u2019re not going to get me. I\\u2019m not afraid of you\\u201d. Once we got several yards upstream we were able to paddle without resistance. We finally got back to the bridge where Rescue was waiting. We found out later by the Medical Examiner that my Dad had suffered a massive heart attack. Over the years I often wondered if the Creatures with large red eyes were keeping protective watch over my dad. I know with as much time, day and night, that my dad spent in those woods and on the water they knew him and they were trying to protect him in his time of need. The clicking sound was alerting me that my dad was near. Another thing, why didn\\u2019t the boat and my dad float off, the creek and the river has a current and there\\u2019s no telling how long it stayed in that spot without floating off, it was not tied off. After many years I finally went back during the daylight to the spot where my Dad died. I got a better reference to where the eyes were and I can tell you this, I couldn\\u2019t tell exactly how tall they were but after seeing the area in daylight the Creatures were very large.

I was on my way to farm-sit for my friends, who have a large piece of property in woods and pasture. It was full dark, with scattered lights from houses and pole lights in some yards. A 4-foot cyclone fence ran alongside the lane, with open gates at intervals. I passed a man walking in the same direction on my left, and shortly after passing him, I noticed someone else moving on the other side of the fence, through the yards. I turned my head to get a better look, and saw the figure from the side and behind as it passed me going the opposite direction on my left. The 'person' was extremely tall and broad. I thought for a minute that it might be a bear, but it was moving completely upright, with the gait of a man. I probably saw it cover about 100 feet very quickly, and it was soon out of my field of vision. The figure was completely uniform in color, with no lines of demarcation that would indicate clothing or skin. Then, with a sense of wonder, I realized that it must have been a Sasquatch. Possibly the line crew working down the street, which had lots of flashing lights going, drove it off its normal path. I don't know why I didn't stop the car to get a better look, except that I was tired and already late getting there. As I got out to unlock the gate, I had a few seconds of trepidation, but was soon greeted by the three large dogs I had come to tend, so I felt secure. That night, I left all the outdoor lights blazing.  About midnight, I was startled awake, but I don't recall what the sound was. The dogs went crazy, and made so much commotion that I had to let them out. Once outside, they just ran around in circles sniffing. They calmed down right away when I let them back in. In the morning, I looked to see if there was something in one of the yards that I could have mistaken for the figure I saw, but I could find nothing. I checked again the following night, in case it was a shadow or something, but again, there was nothing there. I don't think that there would be footprints, as the ground is extremely rocky there, and it has rained heavily since then. The following weekend, leaving early on Sunday morning, I heard a strange scream coming from the woods. I chose to think it was some kind of bird, but it was definitely unusual, and definitely not the peacock which lives in the pasture. On the 21st , I was locking the gate as I left, and the neighbor came out to talk. I told him my story, and he told me that a week or so earlier, he and his wife had been awakened by a loud scream right outside their bedroom. He felt whatever it was must have been inside his fence, a five-foot solid wood enclosure. They were both frightened by it, and had never heard that sound before or since. He also told me he had heard rumors of a couple other recent sightings in the area, but he didn't elaborate.\", \"location_details\": \"I was driving west after turning off the Orting-Kapowsin Highway.

I can not even believe this myself, one sighting in a lifetime is hard enough but when this thing shows itself to me again, I'm starting to think maybe it is hanging around in the same type of woodland areas that I do. I am a Pro. woodsman and most of my outdoor treks take me away from all other human interferance, another words I go where other people do not want to go or will not attempt to go. The reason for this is that in my area the public are getting more and more populated in the areas that I choose to hunt or just get away, so I travel in deeper woods and swamplands away from there interferance. Well as I said I have seen this thing again, and this time it was about 3 miles from where I had spotted it the first time during hunting season. This sighting was as though it was curious or that it was following me, staying in the shadows moving only when I moved. Although this time at first it took me by complete suprise, I remained calm and also let myself observe this thing's every noticed action, trying not to let it have any knowledge that I was watching it as well. I would move taking a slow pace for about 50 yards at a time, turn to my side and kneel down acting like I was picking at the ground. It would stop and watch me from the shadows, as I move another 50 yards and watched it, it would wait till I would get about another 50 yards then it would stop and simulate what I was doing, it would crouch down and paw at the ground where I was kneeling. It would continue to sniff at the air and try to catch scent of me. After about a hour of this cat and mouse it dissapeared. I got a real uneasy feeling when I notice it about 75 yards to my right it was flanking me. This action made me very nervous, I have seen this with coyotes tracking a wounded deer. The thought ran in my mind that it was hunting me, but this feeling passed as I kept moving on. Again it would only move when I would move, perhaps it knew that its movments would be hidden by my coinciding movements, or it was trying to get in a direction of catching my scent. I kept moving in a southeast direction, stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground, keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up. I thought it was gone but noticed it behind a uprooted tree root system peeking through a hole in the roots. It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location, at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face. The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer, no whites only dark. I moved on and after about another half an hour I was getting close to a area that loggers had clear cut, and it was gone. I sat in the area for at least another hour but it did not appear to me again. While I was watching this thing I got a chance to observe it and notice a lot of its features and charicteristics. Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot, it stays in the shadows, has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle. Walks with a hunched over ape like character. I did not notice any smell. And it made no sound. I am convinced that this is a creature that with some time I can get close enough to again. No one can tell me that this freek of nature does not exist.

The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage. We had all been briefed on the history of sightings, tracks, and vocalizations in the area,  and the methods we'd use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening, stayed in touch via walkie talkie, and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices, recording devices, and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area, because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide. The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard. The next day (10 Sept.), the focus moved to a different canyon, near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley, and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage. I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek, about a mile or so from camp, I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us, but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most \\u2013 close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self. I stopped and immediately got on the radio \\u2013 no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me. After about two minutes, I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away. I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp.  After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area.  The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail. Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I'll let the others describe those incidents.  I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions, each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like, the wood knocks, the vocalizations, and all.  The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area, including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado. I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster, and a couple of digital trail cams \\u2013 enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma, Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it.

I also reported this to the Western New York bigfoot association and contacted back and forth with thier director Mike George. He was suppose to come down and meet me so that i could take him out to the location this vocalization occurred , unfortunatley he never made it down. This happened to myself and my long time friend and hunting partner back in winter of 2001. We were out grouse hunting one day in an area know as \\\"Michigan hill\\\" , a state owned piece of land 13,000 acres big near Richford , NY . We had hiked a mile and a half or so off the road with no luck finding any birds when we came upon a large thickly wooded gorge with a creek running through the bottom. We decided to head down the very steep hill into the gorge hoping that in the thick pine and old apple trees would be a few grouse. Once reaching the bottom and crossing over the creek we were both stopped dead in our tracks by a sound which made both of our hairs stand on end. A series of  screaming growls which i can only describe as i have before as a 700 pound hyena with a serious bad attitude had stopped twop grown men with guns instantly. i will tell you as i told the WNYBIC , I have been hunting for over twenty some years and have never , and I mean never heard anything such as this in my life.Well anyway , after two or three of these vocalizations ,which were coming from only about 30 yards away or so through the very thick trees , we decided to move a little closer. What happened then was what really put the scare into us , As we split about 10 yards apart and started to move towards the sound it seemed to move around my partner almost as if it were flanking him , when it moved you could here it walking through the snow and breaking branches and smaller tree limbs , it definitley weighed alot more than in my opinion him and i put together. We moved a little more before it vocalized a few more times  and moved to our left evn farhter as if it were trying to get behind us. Needless to say with all this happening and the constant barking of the dogs from the farm up by the road we were actually getting scared and nervous, whatever was in those trees didnt want us there . after about three or four minutes i glanced over at my friend whom at that time was down on one knee with his gun shouldered as if whatever was there was heading for him . He looked at me and i motioned to him that i thought it was time to leave that area and whatever was down there and headback to the road and truck as quickly as possible. We did just that moving very quickly but cautiously, the whole time looking back over our shoulders till we made the truck. We never spoke to much about what happened but never went back to that place. A year or so later i told something of the story to another friend and huning partner of mine , he was playing with me and said \\\"hey maybe it was bigfoot\\\" , up until then i never thought about that at all, then one day the same friend played me some supposed recording of bigfoot that he found on the internet and my jaw dropped , a sound i hadent heard since that day a little over a year earlier was playing in front of me , belive me when i tell you the chills were enough to kil ya. I had him record the sounds and i called my hunting partner who was with me that day (he had moved to florida ) , i played the sounds over the phone and he had the same chiiling feeling. It was indeed , 100% positive , the exact same vocalizations we experienced that day hunting. A month or so later i contacted the WNYBIC and he i sent them this story along with the tape explaining that the sounds on the tape are exactly what we heard that day , i wanted to know exactly what they were. They responded with two of their own tapes which contained even more supposed bigfoot vocalizations. i could not believe i was hearing the identical sounds we heard that day , then They even top it by telling me that there have been several other sightings and vocalizations from that area and that they would like to come down and check it out for themselves , that was the last contact i had with them , a letter along with the tapes from 2/4/02.

It was the year we got hit with so much snow that year. We were coming back from our friends house as young boys (10 and 8 years old). The snow was very deep as we had to lift up our legs very high to get through the snow. As we were finally getting through the thick woods behind our house and walking into our property, there stood a Bigfoot staring the other way. My brother and I were shocked to see him, just standing out in the middle of our yard looking the other way. We heard about it before and our very first thought was that he might attack us. I told my brother to start reaching for a stick under the deep snow so we can defend ourselves. The Bigfoot was probably about 30 feet away from us. It stood nearly straight up, but with a little hunch. Its height was around 6 1/2 feet tall with a build similar to a human frame. The Bigfoot long brown hair on him, but not too thick as it was possible to see some skin under his fur. As were trying to pull out the stick from the snow, the Bigfoot heard the noise and quickly turned around and looked at us in the eyes. At that time, I was very scared. Our hearts were racing and we were shaking. For about five seconds or so he stared at us and we at him. His facial feature looked like a mix between a human and an ape. He didn't have more of a flatter face but slightly darker colored and thick skinned like an ape. After the stare down, it suddenly turned around and with super human abilities ran around the house in a just a few seconds at the most. The snow was deep, but it ran down our property and took a left turn around the house. It was like the snow never existed as he moved so quickly. I was totally amazed how lighting quick he was. It took huge long steps....that convinced us we saw a Bigfoot. Even if someone was playing a trick on us, there is no one in this world that can run through deep snow in a matter of seconds. This was the convincing point for us. But it's not over. After my brother and I made it back to the house, we yelled for our parents, but of course they didn't believe us at all. Two boys watching monster movies, yeah right... who would believe us! But later that night we heard him again. But this time he was walking on the porch around our house. I heard the snow smashing down as it walked on our porch....crunch, crunch, crunch.. and so on until it stopped right behind my window. We had bunk beds and I was on the top and my brother on the bottom. There was a small push window immediately behind my head, I could feel its presence behind me. I think (but are not sure), it was looking in the window at me. I had sooo many goose bumps on my body, I just jumped out of my bed as quickly as possible thinking he was going to ram his hand through the window to drag me out. As I ran out my brother also followed me and we raced into the living room where our dad always falls a sleep at night on the couch. We yelled that Bigfoot was out there again and of course Dad told us to go back to bed and quit fooling around, it was past our bed time. We kept yelling to him that we were serious, so he got up and looked out the sliding doors. He couldn't see anything outside and told us to go back to bed. We were too scared so we sleep in the living room on the floor. My brother and I never thought about going back outside that same day we saw Bigfoot and look for footprints. Everybody asks us that, but it just never dawned on us to do that. As the years roll by the images and details get more sketchier in my mind. But I am 100% convinced we saw him that day. The solid evidence for me is that he ran through that deep snow in just a few seconds. I'm a fairly serious runner and I know for a fact, that is totally impossible to run through the snow that quick. Bigfoot reminds me of a Heron Bird, you can never get too close to it and it quickly takes off to hide. With the woods and parks by the house and Nelson ledges somewhat close by, I think he maybe hiding in at Nelson Ledges in the caves in the ground. But that's just a hunch. Personally, I have a hard time believing myself at times, because I do not believe in evolution, but at the same time I am absolutely positive I saw him. I don't think we are going to ever find him unless we directly go out looking for him. So many people tell me they don't believe in it because no one has ever found a dead Bigfoot in the forest. But I say that it's just like the many animals in the world, we don't see them laying all around the yard either. If we found Bigfoot though, it sure would be the catch of the century! The world would change dramatically if we were able to study them closely. Good Luck, I think your website will help pinpoint there locations.\", \"location_details\": \"Aproximately 1/4 mile up Pond Road just off of State Route 44 in Newbury, Ohio.

I was armed as there are wild dogs, bears, and a black panther running round back here.  Walking to the far end there are two smaller branches off to your right, the first is shallow and only extends a few yards. Every time I walked to base of the hill before, I felt like I just didn't want to venture into the woods. I had found another way onto the ridge above on the right a few months before-but I also got pretty badly spooked and kind of stayed away. I had trails and just went wherever-until the loggers hit this patch. The past few weeks before this I had roamed all over the logging trails and as soon as they got back there I began to feel very uneasy. Walking alone, I decided to keep looking around staying extra cautious. This day I went left and followed a trail that took me to the ridge top which is dead center of the valley. I also had a very \\\"something is watching me\\\" feeling so I wasn't what you would call happy, just taking note of where things were and enjoying the view. The trail followed along this ridge and would take me near where I had all the strange feelings. I stopped as the feeling of being watched was getting a bit too much when I heard a tree fall, just on the other side of the ridge not more than about maybe seventy yards away. I was wondered just why in the hell would a tree fall but something told me not to investigate and to get off that hill. I decided to turn around to call it a day. I walked maybe ten yards when something loped between two trees on the ridge to my right. My first thought was some loggers or forestry guys were still on the property. It looked to be wearing Carhart brown clothes. I went maybe twenty more yards and then it hit me: I had been on that ridge a few days before, I knew where those trees were and if, IF it was a man he had to be around seven to eight feet tall. A day or two later I went back to the ridge where I saw the thing and took a good look. I never felt any real strangeness on this side and didn't then, but I did confirm that whatever I saw was very big.

At the time I lived with my grandmother in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin, I had lived here also throughout my life, this is a suburb of Milwaukee. The thing is, behind us was a swamp and around us it was pretty wooded. Through my life strange things would happen by our house; strange bangings on the side of our house, really bad stench (always dismissed as skunks), items being eaten in my grandmothers garden, and walnuts being all over the place. These things could have happened with other animals. My neighbor had a stange event once. Anyway, my grandmothers house was a 100 year old farm house. It had a porch and a couple of large windows facing it, in the inside of this part of the house was a little front room with a couch, then the main living room was on the inside of the house next to this room. My son and I had slept on the first floor because it was so hot upstairs, (my grandmother didn't want air), well my son woke me up and said something strange was looking at him, he was really frightned, so he slept next to me on the floor.

I have been trying to find information about Bigfoot in Wisconsin, your site has been helpful; it just seems odd to have a sighting in Menomonee Falls. There is a heavy deer population there and in the surrounding area, it is heavly wooded.

The time was about 4 p.m. I was beginning descending from the area known as The Benson Plateau. Although I am not sure of my exact position it was probably close to 45 deg. 38' 21\\\" N, 121 deg. 52' 24\\\" W at an elevation of about 3,300 feet. The trail was very dry and dusty and the steep decent required that I walk very carefully. As a result I made almost no sound at all. There was suddenly a very loud crashing sound from close by and my thoughts were that a bear had been surprised. At first I saw nothing, but the sound indicated that an animal was fleeing up the steep hillside. Then for about two seconds from a distance of about a hundred feet I could clearly see what looked like a large guerrilla running up the hill. Only the back was visible and it was black. The animal was only visible from the waist up. It had powerful back and shoulders and a very large head that rose to a distinct hump much as it does in pictures of some apes. I do not know how big it was other then to say it was a lot bigger then me. The head was particularly massive I thought. The animal apparently tripped and fell forward, but caught itself and kept moving up through the dense thicket. At that moment it turned its head enough for me to see its head and face in profile. It had a distinct nose but there was little else I could distinguish. At this point I went for my camera. This took a few seconds. When I looked up again I could see motion but could not make out the animal. There was a fallen tree about a hundred and fifty feet up the hill and it began to rock up and down at a uniform rate of about 1 HZ. It made a corresponding creaking and rubbing sound and this continued for some time, perhaps fifteen seconds keeping my attention drawn to that spot but seeing nothing but the tree bobbing up and down like it was being deliberately shaken at a uniform amplitude. Then it suddenly stopped and I could hear nothing. Then I noticed some motion about fifty feet to the right of the tree and thought I could see a face looking at me. The face seemed smaller that the animal I had saw but it still looked like a face and shoulders against a lighter backdrop. I stood with the camera ready knowing that the animal was still there and expecting it to stand up and again show itself. But this waiting game went on for perhaps two minutes. Then I began to wonder if the animal was in fact gone and perhaps I was looking at some strangely shaped stump because it did not move and I could not see it well enough to tell exactly what it was. At this point I took a picture thinking I might blow up the photo later for closer study to determine if anything was in fact there. It occurred to me that I should move around a bit and try to find a better angle. But there was no better position then where I was and caution prohibited me from moving closer. When I returned to my original position I no longer could see the face. I stayed around and listened and watched for a while but noticed nothing. The trail itself was very dusty and took prints well. My own prints were very clear but there were no other prints that I could see. During the incident I smelled nothing. When the digital picture was lightened and adjusted for contrast the head that appeared to be looking at me did look like it could be real. But in the background was what could be another far bigger animal. The larger image in the background is about the right size for the animal I saw. But the front looks like a light tan. I just took the picture and that is all I know about it. The picture quality is poor. Obviously if the animals were willing to pose I might have done better. I went back to the site two times to try to locate the exact position from clues in the picture but have been unable to relocate it exactly. I wanted to get another look and take another picture from the same location just to make sure I was not seeing something that just looked like what I was trying to see. The interesting part is right in the middle of the picture and needs lightning to see properly. I did go back about two days later and explore the place where the animal might have been headed. This area is called Rudolf Spur. All I found there was a pile of shit that was flat as a pancake and looked like tar.

My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of \\\"wild boar\\\" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud \\\"whomp, whomp\\\" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood \\\"whomp\\\" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, \\\"If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!\\\" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the \\\"whomp\\\" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound.

But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud \\\"what the #*%# is that!?\\\" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly. I told my dad about it the next morning and he said he didnt hear anything. People say that bobcats and mountain lions make sounds by \\\"screaming\\\" and it could have been. I really dont know as it was pitch black outside. All I can say is that it sounded like a woman screaming as hard as she could at the top of her lungs for as long as she could and it was it was such a solid level of noise I could feel it......if that even makes sense. I've never heard anything like that. That night after a long hard day of hard fishing with little luck, we ate dinner late because we fished a different stream an we didnt get back to camp until late. We cooked hamburgers in an iron skillet over the fire. The burgers were cooked in the left over bacon grease from breakfast and it smelled and tasted delicious. We were eating our burgers about 11:00 pm when my day said \\\"did you hear that?\\\" and I replied \\\"I didnt hear anything.\\\" As soon as I said that we both heard what sounded like someone yelling at the top of their lungs down by the river in a long \\\"hooooooOHHHHH\\\" yell. The river was about 500 yards away but you could hear it like they were just on the other side of the woods by our camp. It echoed a loooong ways thru the way.  I really dont know how to describe it. It was a really loud and level at first then the yell went up to an even higher pitch and it lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. At that point my dad turned to me and said \\\"What in the H@LL was that!?\\\" and I replied \\\"I dont know!\\\" We sat silently listening for another call but heard nothing. Then we thought it might have someone in trouble but we thought they would have been yelling for help or calling out someones name. Well. after a long restless night of little sleep nothing else happened. My dad and I talked about it the whole next morning. We have both never heard anything like that. It was a really loud, clear, powerful \\\"yell.\\\" So after we got home my dad was telling my mom about it and she laughed and said maybe it was bigfoot. My dad and I looked at each other with surprise on our faces. So to spare you the details, I got on the internet and did some research and found this site. Not only did I find this site, but I found another report from hunters at Wildell who said they saw tracks and one hunter saw 2 \\\"creatures.\\\" At this point my dad and I were a little freaked out. Then I came across the recording section on this website and listened to the recording from Snohomish County, WA and not only did my dad freak out but the hair on both my arms stood straight up and I was covered in goose bumps. That recording is EXACTLY what we heard. I have been a sportsman my whole life, even growing up fishing the mountains in WV, and I never miss a hunting season. I have heard and seen alot of things and I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life, nor has my dad. I havent told many people about this but the ones I have told it too have laughed and thought we were crazy. I dont care what they say or think, I know what I heard 2 nights in row and it really happened and I cant take it back.\", \"location_details\": \"26th across the road parrelling the West Fork of the Greenbrier River.

The sound came from a creek bed about 300 yards from my location. After a few moments I heard it again.  I speculated that it could be some drunk person screaming his lungs out but the timbre was not human in its low or high end of the auditory spectrum. In fear I ran to a neighbors cabin and banged on the door.   I wanted someone else to hear this sound! The call was repeated approximately 10-15 times and the location of the source grew nearer and farther while traversing from side to side.  Neither I nor my neighbor could determine what type of animal could produce such a peircing and bone-chilling sound.  The total elapsed time from first hearing the sound until the last was about 15-20 minutes.  This places the calls at about 1-2 mins apart.

They told me that a group had been hunting in the area but had to leave because there horses were acting up. As I got to the lake I could tell that the horses had been kept in a small meadow near the campsite area. I pitched my tent in this area. I was at the lake doing a little fishing before dark when I heard a howl way off in the distance. I didn't think much of it, it was miles away. There were also several bull elk bugling in the hills behind the lake and at one point I could hear some cow elk \\\"talking\\\". Being an elk hunter myself, I am very familiar with the sounds elk make during this time of year. That was one of the reasons I had gone to this area was to try to call in and get pictures of the elk. As night fell I stayed up until approximately 9:00 PM listening to the sounds of the woods. I could hear a couple owls hooting back and forth across the lake as I fell asleep. At 11:24 PM I was awoken by the same screaming howl I had heard before but it sounded like it was coming from the meadow I was camped next to, about 50 yards away. It sounded like a cross between a wolf and a very loud human. It sounded as if it were a hailing call. I opened the front flap of the tent and grabbed my light and the only weapon I had, my knife. I also grabbed the camera just in case I could see something. The howl had also scared the two owls I had heard hooting earlier that evening. The owls continued to call back and forth to each other for a time after that but I never heard the howl again. I stayed awake for hours after that and eventually was able to relax and get some sleep. I woke up that morning to the sound of bugling elk and when it got light enough I went to look for any sign of what I had heard the night before.

Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn't know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn't running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.

The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010). The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT. The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear \\u2013 brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then. I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building). After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses \\u2013 other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of \\\"knocks,\\\" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm. I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning.  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more. When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing. Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered. There were no \\\"whoops,\\\" \\\"calls,\\\" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a \\\"hard\\\" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin. After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer. During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park.

I was driving on Rte 80 e/b in California at 14:30 hrs. on 08/16/04 and I had just passed the truck inspection station and State Work yard which was west of the Donner Pass. As I was crossing over a bridge which crossed over a ravine with a river through it I looked down into the ravine and saw what looked like (about 7 to 8 foot tall) broad shouldered possibly male, all black from head to toe form stepping from the tree line on the west bank approx. 300 to 400 yards south of the bridge. I immediately pulled over to the side of the roadway on the bridge and slowed so that I could see it better (traffic was extremely light -two other cars.) When I looked down I was able to see that the form had no identifiable clothing or demarcation lines or hat. It then was walking in a lanky movement with arms swinging as it crossed the stream/river. I then noticed a slightly smaller (6-7 foot tall)(pos male due to no obvious breasts or femine movements) come out from the tree line behind the other male trailing him by about 30 feet and slightly south by about ten feet. They both continued across the stream and into the tree line on the east side and disappeared. I sat there trying to evaluate what I had seen. I then concluded that these forms were not any animals I've ever seen. They were one solid color from head to toe with no discernable clothing. They had nothing in their hands or on their feet. I could not come up with any possible concept as too why these individuals would be out there. The temperature was extremely warm so the clothing if it was clothing was way too much.

We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans. Anyway halfway up the mountain my uncle went to the right (SE) and I went left (NW). The southside of the mountain (which I was on) was open with sage brush and scattered cypress trees. In the gulches of the face, were thick timber groves of mainly large pine trees, clustered, only to be seperated by the openess I just described.My plan was to stay in the tree groves working my way to the peak driving the deer to the top of the hill where the other hunter was positioned. I worked the grove until it ended forcing me to cross a clearing to the left to enter the grove located under the peak. When I got to the right vertical edge of the treeline to the grove, I found the first blind. It was made of a broken branch that was placed up side down and leaning against a tree. The branch was interwoven into the branches of the larger tree. At this time I had a feeling I was being watched and assumed it was the other two hunters that weren't in our party that were camped a couple hundred yards from us at the base of the mountain. I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high. The base was about 18\\\" and had been snapped not sawed. Some branches had interwoven into this tree just like the little blind I first discovered on the groves edge. I'd guess the elevation was 8,500 feet, as the top of the hill was 10,000 and our camp was at the base of about 7,000. I now had an increasingly strong feeling of being watched again at this point. As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me. It was perpendicular to me, faced up hill in almost a runners stance, and looking over its right shoulder, at me, slightly with its wide muscular torso turned to me. It's brow was extremly pronounced, its forehead was small with the back of it's head slightly pointed. His head (assuming a male as it did not have breasts,) was proportionatly small in relation to it's body. It's arms were extremly long, hairy, lean yet muscular, It's hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital \\\"C\\\" type shape. It then sprinted up the hill and vanished behind the trees faster than a deer bolts into a dead run from a standstill. It was on the left edge of the grove with a clearing behind it. This all happened in a second or two. I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked. I used a tree that was close by gauge it's height. It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing. I was in a state of kind of shock and almost not believing what I saw but knowing I did and simply just amazed. Because of this when I got home, later that week I decided to consult a hypnotist. I had never seen one but figured since they help witnesses recall a crime and descriptions of accounts that happen quickly or under stress it would probably help me confirm what I saw. The hypnosis confirmed my sighting. \", \"location_details\": \"We went into the backcountry by way of a trailhead off of Highway 4 west of Markleeville, CA.\", \"county\": \"Alpine County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 39181: Deer hunter has sighting in Sierra Nevada Mtns south of Markleeville\", \"latitude\": 38.51665, \"longitude\": -119.6234, \"date\": \"2012-09-23T00:00:00\", \"number\": 39181.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qfgjgszsx\", \"temperature_high\": 64.52, \"temperature_mid\": 55.92, \"temperature_low\": 47.32, \"dew_point\": 32.2, \"humidity\": 0.44, \"cloud_cover\": 0.02, \"moon_phase\": 0.28, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1014.62, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 7.0, \"visibility\": 9.79, \"wind_bearing\": 215.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.31, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.6234 38.51665)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My wife and I had been working as the cleaning crew for a new housing development displaying various model homes on the edge of the city for a couple of months.

I interviewed Bill on December 25, 2010, and for additional details two times again. Bill said that when he was a teenager he went with a group of 11 relatives and neighbors from Detroit camping in the upper Lower Peninsula of Michigan. They camped west of Twin Lakes in northern Kalkaska County. The group was made up of several men, about 7 boys (ages 7 to 12 years), and Bill. They arrived on a Friday morning and set up camp about 50 ft from the road and in a spot where no one else had camped. They cleared away the underbrush and built two rings of rocks for their campfires. The two rock rings were about 30 ft apart. It was early Spring because Bill recalled there were still patches of snow on the ground under the trees during this trip. In the early evening, they roasted marshmallows and hotdogs \\u2013the children sitting around one campfire and the adults around the other.  From behind where Bill was sitting, a rock was thrown into the campsite. About 15 to 20 minutes later, two more rocks were thrown into the camp in quick succession.  The rocks were about the size of cantaloupes. Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp. The rocks had been thrown from beyond their camp clearing. The edge of the clearing was at least 30 ft away from where the rocks landed.  With the first rock thrown, everyone thought someone from their group had thrown the rock as a prank (perhaps while taking a leak in the forest). But when they looked around and saw that everyone was at the campfires, they realized someone else was throwing the rocks. I asked Bill what their reactions were to the rocks landing in their campsite. Bill said that they were surprised and thought it was weird that someone would or could throw such large rocks but no one was alarmed. Bill said that one of the adults had a firearm in his tent, but did not get up to get it. Early the following morning, Bill got up and drove west towards State Highway 66 in order to buy some supplies. He recalls that he was driving with a learner\\u2019s permit, so one of the adults rode with him. The road they were on was a narrow hard dirt road without a maintained, clear shoulder. It was like a fire road or logging road.  Bill had driven about 10 miles west of the campsite when he saw a large animal come out of the forest on the north side of the road. It emerged from the forest on all four limbs until it reached the road. On the road\\u2019s edge, it stood up and walked across the road in two steps, the first step was in the middle of the road, the second on the other side. Because the forest edge along the south side of the road was dense, the animal immediately vanished from sight as it reentered the forest. When Bill saw the animal, the sun was behind him and still very low, the trees cast long shadows, and he was about 50 yards from where it crossed the road. So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride. When Bill got to the spot where he had seen the figure cross, he stopped briefly but didn\\u2019t get out of the truck because the adult he was with told him to drive on. (The adult had been sleeping when the figure crossed the road and awoke when he stopped the truck.)  Because he was driving with a learner\\u2019s permit, he was 15 years old. As such, the year was 1962. He thought about what he had seen during the rest of his trip to the store. He thought what he had seen matched descriptions he had heard or read about sasquatch, but thought sasquatch was only seen in the Pacific Northwest. He had not heard of sightings in Michigan. So when he got to the store, he asked the store owner whether he had heard of any local sasquatch sightings.\", \"location_details\": \"west of Twin Lakes in Kalkaska County, probably on Twin Lakes Road NE (based on the Google Earth May 12, 1994 image), east of State Highway 66\", \"county\": \"Kalkaska County\", \"state\": \"Michigan\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 28668: Man recalls encounter he had as a teenager near Kalkaska\", \"latitude\": 44.76665, \"longitude\": -85.00165, \"date\": \"2011-05-23T00:00:00\", \"number\": 28668.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dpgw9tx8tu\", \"temperature_high\": 70.87, \"temperature_mid\": 55.965, \"temperature_low\": 41.06, \"dew_point\": 57.54, \"humidity\": 0.82, \"cloud_cover\": 0.87, \"moon_phase\": 0.71, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0127, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 999.34, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 6.0, \"visibility\": 9.95, \"wind_bearing\": 232.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.83, \"location\": \"POINT(-85.00165 44.76665)\"}, {\"observed\": \"BFRO Investigators James Walker and Daryl G. Colyer have interviewed this witness extensively.  This report was filed on behalf of the witness, due to his inaccessibility to the internet. The most compelling testimony given by the witness involves an incident that occurred on another lease prior to the one he currently leases, but in the same general vicinity. Approximately 1992, the witness was hunting for deer in the late afternoon.  As he sat on a hunting stool, he continually scanned the surrounding terrain, and noticed some trees in a creek bed area with \\\"buck scrapes\\\" (marks made by male deer with antlers).  The witness focused on that particular area. After a while, the witness noticed a \\\"stump\\\" approximately 125 - 150 yards away that he had not earlier detected.  The witness raised his weapon and observed through his scope what appeared to be a large, gorilla-like animal standing very still, arms down by its side.  At this time, through the use of the rifle scope, the witness was able to observe the animal as though from a distance of only 25 - 30 feet.  The hunter now knew that he was not the only one doing the observing.  The animal was watching him every bit as much as he was watching the animal.  The witness described the animal as having rather thin hair on its body, but the hair almost had the appearance of being combed or groomed.  The color was described by the witness as being \\\"tawny-brown.\\\" After approximately 15 - 20 minutes had elapsed, the witness heard a loud snap of a branch off to his left.  He broke visual with the creature to identify the source of the sound to his left.  When he attempted to regain visual of the creature, he could not do so.  Apparently the animal fled or hid very quickly.  The witness believes that the animal suddenly hid in the tall grass surrounding it in order to escape his scrutiny.  The witness conjectured that the loud snap that he heard was created as a diversion by another creature to distract him from the first creature. At that, the witness quickly left the area - leaving behind the stool and everything else that accompanied him with the exception of his weapon. The witness never once considered shooting the creature and further stated that he felt no hostility whatsoever.  He had absolutely no inclination to pursue or seek out the mystery animal. The creature was described as being \\\"gorilla-like\\\" in appearance, but very distinctly bipedal.  Height was estimated to be between eight to nine feet tall.  Estimated weight was between 400 - 500 pounds.  The face was similar to that of a gorilla.  The nose was flat but \\\"turned upward\\\" and the witness stated that he could actually see into the nose of the animal.  There appeared to be thin facial hair surrounding the mouth, almost in a beard-like fashion.  Hair on the animal had somewhat of a \\\"combed or groomed\\\" look.  The head had somewhat of a round shape and there was no appearance of a neck.  The shoulders appeared very wide.  The witness requested that a sketch artist contact him. This incident is one of many that the witness has experienced through the years.  However, none of the other incidents involved a visual identification of the creature.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Red River County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 7168: Hunter and family has repeated encounters over two decades\", \"latitude\": 33.845, \"longitude\": -95.19722, \"date\": \"2003-11-16T00:00:00\", \"number\": 7168.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9yh299r3rv\", \"temperature_high\": 74.67, \"temperature_mid\": 68.55, \"temperature_low\": 62.43, \"dew_point\": 58.08, \"humidity\": 0.84, \"cloud_cover\": 0.22, \"moon_phase\": 0.74, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Overcast overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 6.67, \"wind_bearing\": 110.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.09, \"location\": \"POINT(-95.19722 33.845)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have often thought I saw someone run  across the road while I deliver the paper.

We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike, and if no one else is near us, we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd, but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock, like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind, and we have heard trees fall in the woods before, so we continued walking thinking nothing of it. We finished the Interpretive Trail Loop and decided to try another trail, this one called the Judge Branch Trail.  This trail parallels a creek and so we were just walking enjoying the woods when we came upon a muddy area with a lot of deer tracks. I used to hunt in my youth and love trying to discern what animals are doing or where they are going by their tracks.  It seemed to me that two or more deer had been fighting or struggling in the area right off the trail, you could see various hoof prints going in different directions and the ground was torn up.  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground.  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes.  The print was off the trail and was perpendicular to the trail. There were some leaves and small sticks on top of the imprint which makes me think that it was an older print.  I weigh more than 280lbs and my shoes did not leave marks next to the print which was about a quarter to half inch in depth.  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful, and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up.   She felt uncomfortable and so we decided to end the hike and head back to the car.  We decided to put the leashes back on the dogs and they pulled hard towards the car.  When they got to the parking lot they once more became relaxed and calm. Also, I could find no other tracks, but we did not venture far off the trail either.  I am not familiar with bears but could this have been a bear track?  I would love to know.\", \"location_details\": \"It is in Frozen Head State Park, the trails have several camping areas.

Around midnight or so, it started to snow lightly even though there were small blowing clouds and huge patches of night sky i.e. moon and stars. At this time I was behind the wheel of my friends big truck, and was concerned about the snow fall. We were riding along a narrow road with a huge drop-off on one side. My friend told me to keep my foot into it or we may slide off! He said there is always a place to turn around at the top of these roads. After turning around, we proceeded back down. The road went straight with a 90' type turn to the right towards the end of the incline we were coming down.

[The hair] was about three inches long and coarse in appearance. It was watching me as well as I was watching it. Its eyes were reddish-brown in color, it had long arms and walked up right never taking its eyes off me, and I never took my eyes off of it. This thing was just looking at me as if it had been watching me for some time. This thing scared me pretty bad if you can give me a call I will give you more details. This thing is out there this is not a joke what I saw was Real! I have never been scared of anything in the woods but this thing was massive in size and I can say this thing scared me, and I have not been back in the woods before daylight since.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Le Flore County\", \"state\": \"Oklahoma\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 8543: Turkey hunter has close encounter with bigfoot in Kiamichi Mountains\", \"latitude\": 34.689, \"longitude\": -94.7325, \"date\": \"2004-04-30T00:00:00\", \"number\": 8543.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9yhtk6cyhf\", \"temperature_high\": 79.68, \"temperature_mid\": 69.03, \"temperature_low\": 58.38, \"dew_point\": 63.84, \"humidity\": 0.86, \"cloud_cover\": 0.58, \"moon_phase\": 0.35, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0456, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Heavy rain until afternoon, starting again overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 7.79, \"wind_bearing\": 166.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.29, \"location\": \"POINT(-94.7325 34.689)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My name is Dr. XXXXXXXXXXX I'm a chiropractor. One afternoon a few weeks back, I was on my way from Show Low, AZ to a ranch past Concho, AZ to work with a horse.  I'm certified in animal skeletal adjusting (chiropractic for animals.) Between the Y in the highway and Concho, about 6 miles outside of Concho, at about 2:30 PM, on a clear, sunny day (Oct. 26, 2006), I saw something come up onto the road about a half mile in front of me.  At first, I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road, but as it fully entered the highway, I could see that it stood straight up, to a height about as tall as a road sign, maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long, dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up, no slouch, no forward bending at all. It ran across the road from my right toward my left and remained fully standing as it ran off into the brush.  The full incident took maybe 10 seconds. The area I live in is plentiful with big animals - elk, deer, bear, big cats.  Many of my patients come to see me for injuries after auto encounters with these big animals.  I've had some very close calls myself.  During the 12 1/2 years I've lived here I've seen several animals I had never seen in the wild before.  Each one, including a coaty mundi, were immediately recognizable.  My far vision is incredibley good. It is my habit to drive hypervigilant for animals here. I'm quite familiar with bear movements since they are pretty well a nuisance to locals and spotted often here.  It's the only other local animal that could have possibly fit the description as far as fur, color and standing height.  However, bear do not stand straight up to run across a road.  In fact, they don't stand straight up.  When they stand, they sort of hunch and hang their front paws.  This did no such thing. Immediately, I was very confused because I thought it looked like how a sasquach is described, but I didn't believe there might be any such thing as sasquach/bigfoot in Arizona of all places.  The Pacific Northwest, maybe, but Arizona?   It was beyond my conception. Since then, my wife and I have been looking for information on the web and have discovered that there have been sightings in this area for years by the White Mountain Apaches, who are generally pretty closed mouthed about it. In retrospect, I realize I should have stopped and searched for tangible evidence, but I had an appointment and didn't want to be late.

Maybe out west it's more thinkable, but Ohio does not even have a resident Black bear or Bobcat poppulation. Could this mammal be so intelligent and elusive that it could remain in our modern world?

During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This \\\"Heat source\\\" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side.

It was New Years Day 2000. There is a state park called Rainbow Springs State Park. I went to the park that morning simply to bird. This is a fairly large state park but only a small fraction of it is open to the public. That morning I wanted to go outside the public areas of that park, just find a trail and keep walking. The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere. I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects. I had a pair of binoculars with me and I was looking for birds as I went along. I figured I was about 2 miles into the park when I came to a clearing, and a stand of White pines on the edge of a field of Saw palmettos. The pine closest to the edge of the clearing had a wood duck box mounted on it. I noticed that right away. It made me laugh because the river or nearest water source was over a mile away. I figured a wood duck that used that nest box would have to be desperate. I decided to look at the box through my binoculars hoping I would see a screech owl using it considering I have seen this quite often.  It was then when I noticed something gripping the tree trunk well below the wood duck box. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm. I raised my binocs to get a better look. What I saw still bothers me today. That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot. I got a very good look at it. It was hugging the tree its face pressed to the back of the tree outta sight from the front. It would peek out to look at me then pull back. It had grayish black skin around its face. It was pretty much hairless. It had a human like nose, with a slight nose bridge and a nose more typical of people of African decent. It was not like an apes nose at all. They have flat noses with upturned nostrils. You could not see its nostrils. It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils. I could see them dart back and forth, very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look. Its lips were thin and it appeared that they were long for its mouth looked rather big. There was very little hair around the face. It pretty thick on the sides and top of the face/head. I couldnt see any ears. It appeared to have a very short neck with the back of the neck kinda fading into its shoulders. It had a small cone shape to its head It looked very muscular but not blulky. I moved several times to my right and left to get a better look and it moved just like a squirrel does around a tree trying to avoid you. I can't say how long this actually went on but it  had to be several long minutes cause I was busy running thoughts through my head as to what I was seeing. The closest thing I could come up with was this had to be an orangutang. The color may have been right but after that, forget it. I decided to move forward,  just to get a better look I took two steps toward it (it was about 100 yrds away) and it ducked down and ran like hell. I didn't see it as it ran away but it left a sea of moving palmettos in its wake. I didn't make any other noice and I didn't smell anything.\", \"location_details\": \"Rainbow Springs State Park FL.

September 2012 on a weekend I was enjoying a moonless night packed with stars. I began to hear dogs barking in the distance to the west. More local dogs started barking. I was expecting to hear the coyotes to chime in as they often do on the hill behind my place. Instead my two 100+lb boxer/labs started going nuts. They would not leave the porch to go into the woods as they often do chasing pigs, coyotes or the neighbor's bull.  I had been out on the driveway and went up on the porch. I stood there and tried to get the dogs to go after whatever it was. I tell you the wind was out of the south. Reason being, as I stepped around the corner of the house something big let out a holler, I can not explain. I think it smelled me then. It was close, probably within 20 yards?  Just past where I have cleared all the trees .  The holler, yell was so strong it felt like it shook my insides. Vibrated.  Everything went stone quiet. All the neighboring dogs and mine went totally silent.their hair on their backs was raised and they were locked on something down hill.  Then off to my right, heading up a tight valley I heard wild pigs grunting and then the sound of a couple raccoons?  I couldn't, understand why they would be together?  Then after a few short minutes the dogs up hill started going nuts and then beyond. Like something was moving fast and the dogs were picking up on it.

We had 4 bear bait sites in about a 30 mile radius. One of the sites was located in Red Oak Township. Every time we would go to this site I had this strange feeling like I was being watched or something. It was spooky. One day just before bear season started I was checking this particular bait pile alone. There was a two track road that wound through the woods up a hill and then down to a swamp. The two track ended at a trail which I would park at the head of and then walk down with two 5 gallon buckets of bear bait which usually consisted of meat scraps and pastries. On this particular day I had just dumped the bait on the bait pile and was walking up the path to my truck. The cover was fairly thick but thined out the closer you came to the two track. I was about 60 yards in from the two track and could see it when something very strange happened. I creature of some sort I would say about 7 to 8 feet tall walked across the two track. This creature crossed the two track in one step. I have seen bears and run across bears in the woods before but I can say for sure this was definitely not a bear. I was so startled that I just stopped in my tracks and said to myself, \\\"what in the he** was that?\\\" I walked closer to where the creature crossed I kept getting the overwhelming feeling of fear. When I got to the spot where I thought this creature had crossed I stopped and looked in the direction in which the creature had walked looked. about 30 feet or so behind a large cedar tree I could make out what appeared to be a a face which was defintly not a bear but not a man either. It looked kind of black like a mountain gorilla would. I thought I was seeing things so I kind of blinked a few times but it was still there after about 15 seconds the creature turned away from me and disappeared into the woods. All the time this was happening I just could not shake this feeling of dread or doom. I have hunted and fished all over the state of Michigan and have never been afraid of anything that I have encountered but this really shook me. I can best describe the creature as about 7 to 8 feet tall very dark in color and like I stated previously had a face that looked like a cross between a man and a gorilla. I have never seen anything that even came close to this. Up until now I was a non-believer in Bigfoot. I always figured that what people were seeing was bears walking on there back legs.

But the sound seemed to be coming from one individual and was carrying very far.  It was a really loud howling changing into a type of whining bark and then ending almost like a hoot.  It was a sound that puzzled me because I am knowledgable in the sounds of wildlife and had never heard anything like it.  I also knew somehow that it was impossible for a human to make that sound, yet it sounded eerily human. Since I only heard it once I sucked it up and started walking out of the circle of light streaming from the shower building and towards the girl's cabins.  Of course my cabin was the last one on the end and of course most people had forgot to turn on their porch lights.  None of this bothered me though until I heard the noise again.  It was a little closer and louder and it frightened me that it wasn't just a one time thing as it immediately \\\"called\\\" again after the second time.  I wasn't afraid I was going to get attacked or anything but it would be nice to be indoors so I started walking faster. The sound was repeating itself again and it sounded as if whatever was making it was getting still closer and paralleling my path.  I finally decided to break into a run and quickly reached my cabin, entering it.  The time that had elapsed from when I first heard the \\\"call\\\" til when I entered my cabin was probably a minute and a half since I ran some of the way back to my cabin.  I also didn't hear anything else after I got inside but that may be due to the fact that I put on my discman to calm my nerves.  Also, the number of \\\"calls\\\" I heard in the elapsed time were about seven, some flowing into each other near the end. The next day I told the camp director and a few other counselors what had happened but they brushed it off as being a turkey or a dog and even though I didn't know what it was, I knew it wasn't one of these two.  Being a prankster and practical hoaxster wasn't on my side because many thought I was joking.  When I wouldn't relent with my story I was poked fun at and so I think anyone else that may have heard anything may have been discouraged from saying anything. I didn't make this report sooner because I didn't discover the website until a few months ago and I have been searching the internet for sound clips of wild animals to maybe rule out or make a possible connection with what I heard.  Everything I listened to was worlds away from what I heard, except for sound clips of supposed Sasquatch that were available on this site and some others.\", \"location_details\": \"The location was on Bunch Walnut Road, on the North side of the Northwest River about 1/4 of a mile away from the river.\", \"county\": \"Chesapeake City County\", \"state\": \"Virginia\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 4788: Screams heard in the Great Dismal Swamp\", \"latitude\": 36.5884, \"longitude\": -76.28729, \"date\": \"2000-07-21T00:00:00\", \"number\": 4788.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dq9b0h9qck\", \"temperature_high\": 81.65, \"temperature_mid\": 74.04, \"temperature_low\": 66.43, \"dew_point\": 68.77, \"humidity\": 0.82, \"cloud_cover\": 0.71, \"moon_phase\": 0.66, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1013.49, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 8.0, \"visibility\": 8.56, \"wind_bearing\": 200.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.25, \"location\": \"POINT(-76.28729 36.5884)\"}, {\"observed\": \"It was winter in 1986-87 in Central Illinois, Morgan county, just 3 miles east of Jacksonville off the old state road.

We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick, his pregnant wife Jennie, their 5 year old son Atticus, and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took \\u201cfour large, quick, heavy steps\\u201d back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick, Atticus, and I slept in a tent while Jennie, Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.

My brother and father and I were hunting squirrel. The funny thing was, this was our first hunting experience except for our father. Dad was born and raised in this part of the country. We had moved to Springboro, which is south of Dayton, when he decided to take us on a \\\"hunting trip.\\\"... Me and my brother were not the \\\"outdoors type,\\\" both of us being born in Dayton. My father had borrowed the guns we were using, since we would probably never go again. Me and my brother both knew how to shoot a gun, just never hunted wildlife before. Anyway, we were on our first \\\"safari,\\\" very excited and scared at the same time. The year before, my brother and I had got walkie talkies for Christmas. Not the cheap kind, but a nice set with a range of a \\\"mile\\\" under normal circumstances.. which was..... ha ha apparently not hills and \\\"hollers.\\\" Sorry, back to the sighting... We had split up a few hills back, each combing a hill or two. I heard a few shots from two different directions before it got very quiet. Birds had been chirping as the sun was high and the temperature had to be well within the 80's. I was at the top of a \\\"holler\\\" and decided to go down, instead of staying on top of the hill. As I descended, I got a weird feeling, as though I shouldn't be there or something else. I started to call my brother on the walkie talkie when I heard a loud sound coming from the right of me and fifty some yards down. I thought, why is someone running? As I approached it from behind, I turned off the walkie talkie so I didn't disturb what I was about to see. At first I thought it was a bear, but it was sitting on a large rock. Then I thought it was my father playing a trick on me, trying to scare me, but he didn't have a costume when we started to hunt. Did he bring one earlier? As this is going through my mind it stood up, I was coming quietly down the \\\"holler.\\\" I now could hear noise to my left and then right, like people just walking, not trying to draw attention to themselves. What gets me is that it never turned around, like it knew I was there. I was above wind, so how? As it stood, I was maybe 30 yards behind it, I never saw what was to my left and right, but it took off like a shot of lightning. I am now 6 foot 2 and 300 pounds, this thing was at least 8 foot tall and between 350 pounds and 450 pounds. I stood there for what felt like forever, a horrid odor had filled my senses, making me want to cry. I decided to go back up the \\\"holler\\\" away from what I had seen. I stood on top of that hill, calling my brother on the walkie talkie telling him to hurry. My father got there first, which I never understood, and he looked old and tired. I asked why are you standing so alert? He said \\\"we should leave now.\\\" As we were leaving in the truck, I asked why leave so early?

I've already seen bears (black bears and a grizzly in YellowStone). Last year in October 2000 I visited Olympic National Park and the  last day of my stay I hiked on a loop trail begining at \\\"Obstruction Point\\\". I let my car at the park located at the end of Obstruction Point road which is about 6 miles long and is a not very good track (no tar and some holes). At the beginning of this road near Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center there was a pannel indicated that overnight stays were not permitted. When I arrived at the car-park around 10.30AM, there were no other cars. I hiked to Grand lake and Moose lake that I reached at about 12.30. I stay there about one hour and then I return via the \\\"Badger Valley trail\\\". At about 4.45PM I was at the bottom of Obstruction Peak just bellow the car-park and I decided to stop to have a rest before climbing. So I looked around and noticed two \\\"hikers\\\" who where walking on the \\\"Elk Moutain trail\\\" towards the car-park. I looked at them with my binoculars because I didn't see anyone for the whole day and I was curious. They were at about 500 meters from me in the late afternoon sunshine and I was in the shadow so I think that they couldn't see me. My binoculars are not very good but I immediately noticed that they carried no equipment (no bags, no sticks...)and that they seemed to be very tall. There were no trees on the trail to confirm that impression but they really seemed to me very tall, specially the second one. Then I notice that they were \\\"dressed\\\" in a uniform dark colour from the top of their heads to the tip of their hands and legs (I couldn't see their feet because I was below them). I could not see any other colours on them even on their faces or their hands. I thought that they were looking like giants dressed as the police special forces men! I decided to look specially at the second one because I could not see the two of them in the same time in my binoculars. I noticed he had a strange way to walk: His head was down like he was looking at his feet and his arms which seem very long (the hands were at the same level than the knees) were moving amply. It was like he was tired (because of the position of the head) and alert (because of the movment of his arms and legs) in the same time! At one moment the first one who was walking about 10 meters ahead stopped to look at the second one but didn't wait for him and continue to walk. Then I began to think that these two hikers were really strange and I realise that they were walking in the same direction than me so I climb to the car-park as fast I can to check if they had a car there. I was thinking that if there was another car beside mine it would prove to me that everything was OK and that these two \\\"hikers\\\" were just like me. But when I arrived at the park there was no other car so in a very short time I thought that: 1- it was almost the end of the day. 2- We were 6 miles from the concrete road. 3- It was forbidden to make an overnightstay in this area. 4- These two strange looking \\\"hikers\\\" didn't carry anything on their back to spend a night in the outback. And I thought about the patterson film I saw on a  TV show some years ago so I decided to get out of  there very quickly. I did not see any car or people until I reach the concrete road and the Hurricane ridge visitors center. I know now that the patterson movie is maybe not the hoax I thought it was.

Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch.  about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline.  The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river.  We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill.  I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention.  As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us.  There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer.  I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound.  We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run.

I'v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters, but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature.  We don't know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around.  That was probably the last time I have been on the lake.

The below single track was well defined and very recent, as the grass was still coming out of the print whilst I observed it.

I was in the south prairie area on the north end of the lava flow. As I had seen a cow and a calf tracks in a area south and east of the area we were in, we planned to return to a  different spot via a circuitous route using the available cover and watch a park like area that isn't easily viewed for the evening hunt. This overlooked a sandy area that was the result of flooding outflow. Laying down a volcanic pumice like sand. I was keeping track of the tracks that went up and down the temporary water bed as it effectively cut the prairie in half making it convenient to get a \\\"snapshot\\\" of the previous evenings events. These were all marked and noted each morning when in the area. I was narrowing my hunt down to these two animals. That evening, while looking over the prairie and glassing the adjacent treeline from the cover of a large tree, I heard a knock or thwack about 150 yards out (Since I was elk hunting I thought it was an antler strike). This was about 10 minutes before the end of legal shooting light as I keep close track of my time when finishing out the day's hunt. Optimistic about the next day's scenario already, we headed for the truck assisted with flashlights. Which we did not turn on until we were well away from this spot as we intended to be back in the morning before day break. We also used the available trees and cover to mask our departure as well. Next morning, we returned and set up on the previous evenings spot. After the sun was well up I and my son went out on to the prairie to check the sandy wash for sign. This is where we saw three distinct tracks, one in the sand then two deeper ones about 80 inches apart with the last easily defined print on the other side of an log that I could tell, didn't even break it's stride for. These were identical to yesterdays tracks, size, depth shape etc. I feel that it was the same animal.

My husband and I recently moved to a remote area of Fairfield County, SC near the Blair community.  The house we are renting has been vacant for quite some time and is near a thickly wooded area; our house backs up to the woods.  We finished moving in last Sunday.  There are no other homes in sight, though there are a few down the road from us.  We drive 23 miles to the nearest town for shopping. Last night (Monday, May 8) my husband and I were half watching TV, half dozing when it occurred to me the sounds I was hearing outside the back window were getting strange.  At first in the back of my mind I thought it was an owl; then I thought it must be the noisiest owl on record.  We are both hard of hearing and had the TV turned up pretty loud and the windows closed.  Then I realized it was more than one, and they were calling to one another, and seemed to be getting closer. I became alarmed around 11PM when one of our two dogs started barking in response to the noise.  They are on our enclosed back porch and we keep the door to the outside open so they can go out to a small enclosed yard area when they need to.  I went out to the porch and turned on the light, and they were very nervous and happy to see me.  After I calmed them down I stayed on the porch and listened in earnest.  What I heard sounded like a rhythmic hoo hoo hoo HOOOOOO, but unlike owl or dove sounds, it was very deep and loud, not at all birdlike.  My husband and I could not identify it, we kept saying \\\"is that coyote?  wolf?\\\"  and as soon as we would say it we would just shake our heads.  We both grew up and camped, hiked and traveled extensively in the West and know what coyote and wolf sound like. We discerned there were at least three distinct voices fanned out - to the south of our house, directly behind, and to the north, all to the west (wooded) side.  Upon listening at length and discerning a pattern, which seemed to relate to our presence there somehow, I was concerned enough to lock the dogs up on the porch and turn on all the lights to the outside. As the calling continued to move closer, the dogs cowered in the far corner of the porch.  We then realized our indoor cats had been missing all evening.  We found them up in our attic underneath boards we leaned against the wall in preparation for adding shelves there.  When we brought them down they ran right back up there and we didn't see them until morning. Also, the usual night sounds were absent.  Nothing else made a sound while this went on, and it lasted for at least two hours.  Towards the end, another call was so close I nearly panicked, and this one was making rapid hoo HOO noises interspersed with almost talking? sounds, while moving very quickly from the south to the north.  The others were answering rapid-fire.  I can't describe it any better than that, other than to say it wasn't yips or croaking or any of the normal animal sounds we hear out here, but very loud, deep and rapid and most certainly they were communicating with each other.  It was scary and intimidating, and if I had been in a camping situation I would have run for my life. My husband is a rural mail carrier out here and knows everyone.  He talked to several people today and they all said they have heard the sounds before but they don't know what they are either, most think they must be wild dogs. They can't be serious, if they have really listened.  But it doesn't surprise me.  I figure it must be this way with most people when confronted with something unknown and unexplainable, to come up with just about any explanation at hand and dismiss it. I decided to get on the Internet and see if I could find recordings of wild dogs and birds and find something similar.  After a day of searching I found the recordings of wolf and coyote here and the whooping and calls we heard most closely resembled the suspected bigfoot whoops on this site.\", \"location_details\": \"[The address provided, but was removed from public posting per request of witness]\", \"county\": \"Fairfield County\", \"state\": \"South Carolina\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 14611: Possible vocalizations heard by new residents in an unpopulated rural area near the Broad River\", \"latitude\": 34.421, \"longitude\": -81.396, \"date\": \"2006-05-08T00:00:00\", \"number\": 14611.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dnn5gf1hze\", \"temperature_high\": 62.09, \"temperature_mid\": 58.41, \"temperature_low\": 54.73, \"dew_point\": 52.75, \"humidity\": 0.86, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.35, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 50.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.17, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.396 34.421)\"}, {\"observed\": \"This happened at Oubache State Park near Bluffton Indiana either the summer of 1989 or 1990. I was working as a night watchman at the front gate and had been watching television when I decided that I needed to get something out of my Ford Bronco. The area leading up to the park is heavily forested with trees that had been planted by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression. The road leading into the park was about a third of a mile long. As I stepped outside the booth and was crossing the road to the parking lot, I heard the most terrifying scream that I have ever heard in my life about 250 yards to the southwest of my location. At the same time that I heard the scream I also heard a tree snap and break and fall to the ground. The tree sounded to be quite large. The weather that night was very calm and there was no wind at all which could account for this tree falling down. I quickly turned around and headed back for my booth and sat down to think about what just happened. I felt like I was in a daze for a few minutes as I was trying to think what a logical explaination of this event could be. I sat there for about 45 minutes and after I had settled down a bit, I decided that it must have been my imagination playing tricks on me and I proceeded to head back out to my truck. I was walking toward my truck and had gotten to the exact same spot that I was in previously when I heard the horrible scream when I heard it once again and this time it was about 50 yards away from my booth. I once again quickly retreated to my booth and sat there until daylight. Once day light arrived I walked out in the woods to investigate but found nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't walk far enough out to find the tree as I was still quite unsettled by what I heard. I have heard screech owls and bobcats but nothing, absoultely nothing, that compares to the sound that I heard that night. I can't say to this day what it might have been, but this has bothered me for about 16 years and I still think of it evey now and then.

(from the AP wire) [Are Big Footprints Bigfoot's? RICE LAKE, WIS. Bigfoot in Wisconsin? That's the possibility under investigation in the Rice Lake area, about 70 miles northeast of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Brad Mortenson of the U.S. Expedition and Exploration Society said three tracks found Monday could be from the mysterious -- some say mythical -- ape-like creature known as Bigfoot. He describes the tracks as about 16 to 17 1/2 inches long and 8 inches wide at the widest. Asked about the shape, he said: ``It looks like a big foot. It's very distinct.'' One print showed five toes, he said, and the impressions indicated a creature with a stride of about 4 1/2 feet, typical for the Bigfoot. Mortenson, 41, of Sarona, said he started receiving reports about possible Bigfoot activity after a local newspaper story two weeks ago told about his work with the society, based in Doris, Calif. ``After that we started getting the reports of people across the tracks in the Blue Hills,'' he said. That's the hilly, wooded region around the Barron County-Rusk County linewhere a preliminary search turned up the tracks this week, he said. He said he planned to do more preliminary searching, and if enough signs are found, the society would bring in equipment and personnel for a full search. ``I'd like to be a little more certain . . . before I commit the society to the expense of a full-scale expedition,'' he said. The Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, is said to inhabit remote regions of the Pacific Northwest, but Mortenson said there also have been a lot of sightings in Florida , Ohio and Maine. He said he became involved searching for Bigfoot in northern California in the 1970s, and he now serves as the society's international director of operations.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Barron County\", \"state\": \"Wisconsin\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 1105: Newspaper article about a track find and investigation\", \"latitude\": 45.5, \"longitude\": -91.71295, \"date\": \"1997-11-07T00:00:00\", \"number\": 1105.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"cbnfc508tq\", \"temperature_high\": 40.93, \"temperature_mid\": 36.44, \"temperature_low\": 31.95, \"dew_point\": 34.83, \"humidity\": 0.87, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.25, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Overcast throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 7.79, \"wind_bearing\": 200.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.32, \"location\": \"POINT(-91.71295 45.5)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I wanted to comment on your report case #8595.

While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large, brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn't see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker, another animal, or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again, it was a three knock pattern, along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large, brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line, large shoulder, and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left, towards the lake, then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife, bear spray, and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees! I would be willing to send the pictures we took.  Two are extremely blurry due to my hand shaking, my husband took two other pictures, one you can see the head if you zoom up and the other it appears it moved.\", \"location_details\": \"Campsite at Surprise Lake in the Eagle Nest Wilderness.

We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby. To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road.

We stopped and listened thinking it was an bull elk. Again, the scream came 30 seconds after the first scream. Right then, I said \\\"that don't sound like a bull elk at all\\\". As I said that, another scream came which seemed to lasted a lot longer. At this point in time, we decided to leave the area. We didn't know if the scream was coming closer to our location. \", \"location_details\": \"This incident took place about 7 miles north of Sawmill,  Arizona, on the White Clay Road after passing the power lines.

The friend of mine noticed a set of eyes shining in the woods while looking down a small trail. We were wearing headband style flash lights and he told me to check it out. As I looked down the trail it was very obvious to me that the eyes were far enough apart and high enough off of the ground to justify being concerned. I convinced myself and my friend that whatever it may be, its more afraid of us than we were of it. A while later, maybe 20 minutes or so, he mentioned that it was still there starring at us. I walked slightly closer to the opening of the trail in an attempt to make out what it may have been, but still couldn't tell. A few minutes later, same thing... it was still there and still starring towards us. I tried to make noise and decided to yell at it. It apparently wasn't too concerned b/c it didn't so much as blink or move. We again convinced ourselves that it was nothing to be afraid of. We continued with fishing and not long after my friend noticed that it had finally moved on. We thought nothing more of it until I got the biggest scare of my adult life. As I was standing there, something let out the deepest, slowest growl that I've ever heard in my life. It sounded as though it was standing directly behind me and very close. I turned to look at my friend and the look on his face told me that I was not hearing things. Without a second thought or a spoken word, we dropped our fishing poles and ran as fast as we could to the truck. We jumped in and locked up tight. My first question was if he had heard it and his response was \\\"yes, what was that?\\\" We were so scared that we weren't sure what to do. The decision was made a couple of minutes later to start the truck and turn on the headlights. He raced the engine and blew the horn repeatedly. Even after a few minutes of doing this and feeling sure that whatever is was had to have left the area, we were still VERY hesitant to retrieve our fishing gear. After a long while of deciding, we very quickly jumped out, THREW our things into the back of the truck, and left. We had both lived in Florida for some time. We spent a lot of time on the water and in the woods, fishing and camping in remote locations. Never before, NEVER, have I heard anything like it. I can say 100% that it WAS NOT an alligator or a bear. Beyond that I have no idea. I do know that whatever is may have been convinced two grown men, both of them, to immediately go out and purchase handguns to carry during each and every future outing! Not sure where the sound clips of the growls come from on the \\\"finding Bigfoot\\\" television series... but they are about the closest thing I've heard to the sound I heard that night.

That's when her and her friends ran inside and told me. We checked outside around the front but saw nothing. So they went in her room after that.  Me and my girlfriend stayed in the living room and watched TV. When we heard some noise in the dinning room I said,\\\"what was that?\\\".  She said I dont know so I jumped up to see. Some of the girls came out to see what the noise was. It was like somebody throwing stuff around in the room.  When I got to the dining room I saw a large hand reaching in the window. It reached across a table by the window and pulled out a bowl that had some food in it. We all got scared and I called the conservation office. Nothing else happened after that.

We have hunted together for many years through all sorts of terrain and conditions, and have developed a certain uncanny sense for each other and the mountain. Normally I would not entertain writing this, but I have again been awaken by the re-occuring dream/nightmare of this mis-adventure.  The incident began after some brutal unsuccessful elk hunting on the Bethal Ridge above the Oak creek.  We are both local and know the mountain better than most. We decided to head over to the Cowiche were I had tagged a nice young bull the year before. The area supports a fair local herd and is extremely rugged. We had access to an area through a friend that owned some property and lived a very primitive lifestyle up there. Frank is his name and being a little eccentric his tales of bigfoot and not being caught on Divide ridge after dark were scoffed at by myself and hunting partner Justin. Anyway, we headed straight up the ridge in my hunting rig in late afternoon to pitch camp. We encountered three other rigs coming back down as the sun was setting. They were driving at a high rate of speed. I new one of the guys, he's a logger up there, and he stopped to warn us of the Divide Ridge after dark deal. I said thanks, see ya, and he proceeded back down the mountain, fast. Justin commented about being a bunch of wimps. We found a fair sight to spend the night. As some weather was coming in, we picked the heavily wooded very dense north slope to put out our bedrolls. The place had an eerie feel to it and I dismissed it as being in my head. We were gathering wood by flashlight for a fire when we both stopped and simultanously looked at each other. \\\"You smell that?\\\" \\\"Yeh, it's probably a couger kill\\\". A very strong rancid odor, not like rotting meat decay, just a putrid smell. We got a fire going and I put on a pot of venison chili. Justin started building the fire bigger and bigger. This was uncommon for him. I asked him. He stated \\\"something ain't right up hear tonight\\\" and I said I agree. We both know fear feeds on fear and dismissed it at that. Then we heard the first whistle/howl. The first one was distant and we could here clearly due to no wind and the cold. When elk call each other, people not familier with wapiti can mis-interpret these calls as whistles. This was no elk. Justin got out his cow elk call and responded with a short set of chirps. I got out my Weatherby and .44 Magnum. Something was not right. There was no initial response to Justin's cow calls. I put some more wood on the fire. Then came the second shrill howl, in the creek bottom right below us. It was loud and like nothing else we have ever heard and believe me when I tell you we have hunted every manner of \\\"known\\\" species in these mountains. My hair was literally standing on end. Justin said \\\"we're outta here right now, cover me, I'm pitching camp\\\". He started packing tarps and gear while I sat listening and watching, heavily armed. Justin is one of the most fearless men I have ever met. He was white with fear. Next thing we heard was feet walking in the snow, very loud crunching. Justin just about knocked me over getting to my rifle. The scarey part is, we have crashed enough hooved ungulates through the woods to know the sound of four legs crunching snow. This was very deliberate walking, not crashing or running. I screamed out that we were locked and loaded and who ever is out there to come into the light, hoping someone would. The crunching snow stopped. Now both Justin and I are very seasoned and responsible hunters and probably the last ones to shoot at noises in the dark, but this had gone far beyond that. There was something standing out there in the dark, large and not scared of us, which for any manner of \\\"known\\\" species in our mountains is unusual.  This silent standoff went on for about two minutes. We could see nothing outside the light of the fire and lanterns. Now mind you this creature was close enough that we could hear it walking in the snow, so we knew it was still there, but there was no smell. I called out one more time and we fired one shot from my pistol into the air. Then all hell broke lose. There was a loud short grunt and running feet crunching in the snow, and we started firing reloading and firing. We did not stop shooting till we were loaded and well on our way. After a harrowing drive off the mountain at night in the snow, which I do not reccommend to even experienced drivers, we made it back to the my ranch. My wife took one look at us and knew something was truely wrong. Justin refused to talk the whole drive off the mountain. And to this day refuses to talk about it. I have no desire to go back up Divide Ridge to investigate. It is 3:00 A.M. and I'm am writing this after I was awaken again by this same incident. I am still an avid hunter, but I stick to Bethal Ridge. Make no mistake, this incident has changed my perspective.

We almost immediately knew that this thing wasn't a person, but was something else. My friend immediately told me to stop the car, which I eventually did. I watched this thing and could see that it was quite large, or bulky, because the arms and legs looked pretty huge. There was no features I could make out, it was all one color.

I was about 14 years old and in the Boy Scouts. My troop was from Portland, Or., and we were attending a Boy scout summer camp near Spokane somewhere....I can't remember the exact name of the camp...but it was near Spokane. The different troops lived in various campsites ringed around a lake and a main lodge. My troop had one of the furthest campsites from the lodge and the lake. During the daytime, our campsite was normally empty. For the first few days everything was fine and then things started coming up missing and evidence that someone had been going through our belongings was evident. Needless to say, one morning I woke up and felt sick. I was given permission to stay in my tent and rest while everyone else left and partook of the morning festivities. Well, I was resting in my tent and thinking about what would happen if the thing or person going through our camp showed up while I was there alone. Then in the distance I heard the voices of boys from my troop making there way back to camp. One boy was in the lead of the group and just about back into our camp when I heard him yell \\\"Hey, what are you doing?\\\" I knew I was the only person in camp and I was not visible as I was in my tent...I darted out of my tent and looked down the trail to my right and saw my troop mate...then something flashed by to my left. It was upright on two feet and all I can really say is that it was large and brown. At the edge of our camp it darted into the brush and proceeded up a small incline. Whatever it was moved with incredible speed and ease through this thick underbrush. It stopped at the crest of the hill and looked back at us....Then we being young and dumb started into the brush...and it turned and disappeared. I am not sure what I saw...I do know it was in two legs and moved quicker than any human I have ever seen, through some very, thick brush.\", \"location_details\": \"It is a Boy scout camp that is on a lake in Eastern Washington...that is all I can remember about it.\", \"county\": \"Spokane County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 10354: Boy scout observes large brown animal on two legs run by him\", \"latitude\": 47.62769, \"longitude\": -117.3606, \"date\": \"2005-02-15T00:00:00\", \"number\": 10354.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c2kwcqke7u\", \"temperature_high\": 35.43, \"temperature_mid\": 26.12, \"temperature_low\": 16.81, \"dew_point\": 12.58, \"humidity\": 0.6, \"cloud_cover\": 0.17, \"moon_phase\": 0.24, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1028.82, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 352.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.55, \"location\": \"POINT(-117.3606 47.62769)\"}, {\"observed\": \"It was about 1:00 am on 10/21/06 when I was camping in the Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the Palo Duro Canyon trail run the following morning.

I never gave it much serious thought until two or three years ago a strange animal was sighted near Bloomfield, IN were my Sister lives.  This event re-ignited my interest and I began doing a little research on the subject and ran across your website. Since then a co-worker John (not his real name) told me about an experience he and his wife and son had last summer on a 600 acre farm along Blue River in southern Indiana near Fredericksburg. The farm belongs to the C.E.O. of our company. He uses it for recreation only.  There is a house on the property but no one lives there. Over the past few years he has some problems with the folks who used to own the property and one of the neighbors stealing things and tearing stuff up. My friend/co-worker is not at all interested in cryptozology or Bigfoot and would not take the time to write this report, therefore, with his permission I am submitting this report to you on his behalf. By June, we were all stressed out trying to finish our project on time. John (my co-worker) said he took his wife and 12 year old son out on 4 wheelers, to the boss's farm for some fishing and stress relief.  I ask him how the fishing was and he said \\\"We didn't catch a thing, but I think that crazy drug fiend was back their messing with us\\\"! \\\"What do you mean\\\", I ask. \\\"We were fishing in the river and right after it got dark somebody kept throwing BIG rocks or something in the water where we were fishing trying to scare us off. I think it was that nut that used to live on the property or the crazy neighbor\\\" he continued, \\\"I just couldn't get a look at him\\\".  He was adamant about how big of a splash it was making and went on and on. I was intrigued and said, \\\"Tell me the whole story from the beginning\\\". This is how he related the facts to me about what happened to him, his wife and son. They drove the truck to the back of the property, unloaded the 4 wheelers and drove down the hill into the dry stream bed and followed it to where it intersects with Blue River. They arrived about 8:00 p.m. They were set up in the mouth of the dry stream bed where it dumps into Blue River. They had a lit a Coleman lantern as it became dark about 8:50 p.m. It had been dark for almost an hour when they heard a huge splash in the water about 150-200 feet up stream (to their left). His son asked \\\"What was that?\\\" It was a big splash. He explained to his son that it was probably just a limb broke off and fell in the water.  They continued fishing, talking, and relaxing.  After a minuet or so there was another big splash in the water.  This time it was a little bit closer. He described the sound of what ever was hitting the water as large enough to make a huge splash and then rain water droplets for two or three seconds afterward. It was loud enough to be heard over a 100 feet away in a running stream of water. He said it sounded like something the size of a bowling ball, or a heavy log; say 8 inches in diameter and 20 inches long, or a similar large heavy object hitting the water with great downward force. So by now he's kind of wondering what's going on here? He can't see anything beyond the circle of light projected from the lantern so he goes to the 4-wheeler to retrieve an ultra high intensity portable search light. Just then splash! A third time still closer, he shines the light around and doesn't see anything. The brush around the creek bank is pretty dense. They are standing a dry feeder stream basin about eye level to the ground on the surrounding banks so it is extremely difficult to see very far.  His son is kind of scared now.  John starts talking out loud \\\"Alright, I guess I'm going to have to get my gun out now\\\", as he rattles around in the tackle box. Splash! Just then a fourth object hits the water yet closer to them, still upstream a little. Again all of these objects, though never seen, are appearently 10-20 lb. hitting the surface displacing a large spray of water. My friend is mad now. He's shining the light around, turning it off and on trying to pick up any movement, looking for any anything that will indicate who is doing this and where they are.  He shouts out loud, \\\"Come on out where I can see to shoot\\\".  All of this is a bluff of course, as he doesn' t really have a gun at all.  So then he turns the light off and listens. A minuet or two passes then Splash! This time he is ready with the light and sees the spray of water from the impact about 30-40 feet away. At this point his son is pretty scared and ready to leave. He keeps trying to determine where the objects are coming from.  He can not tell if whoever is throwing them is on the opposite bank or on his side further upstream to the left. He said he feels like they were coming from the opposite bank, but he never saw anything to confirm or deny this notion. The opposite bank is a steep hillside that goes up a hundred feet or more at an angle of about 80 degrees. Their side is relatively flat with an open meadow and tree line along the bank to their left and dense woods to the right. By now his son was very scared and they have decided to pack up and leave. As they gathered their gear, Splash! something hits the water again about 20 feet away! Finally just as everything was ready to go, Splash! something big hit the water so close the water spray hit the bank where they had been standing a few seconds earlier. John said this time he saw the column of water spray shoot up into the air about 20 feet. He indicated there did not seem to be a forward or directional component to the objects path. He said it looked like something had dropped straight down out of the sky into the river.  At that point they climbed on their 4-wheelers and rode back to the truck. The whole time he was telling me this story he became more agitated over who ever it was messing with them and spoiling their fun.  The thought of a creature doing this never crossed his mind.  Of course I was trying not to jump headlong to that conclusion, but I was very intrigued to say the least. John said he checked his watch and all seven objects had hit the water within 12 to 15 minuets at approximately 1.5 to 2 minuet intervals.  (F.Y.I.  Blue River is about 30 to 40 feet across at the point where they were fishing). I ask him, & \\\"Did you hear anything?\\\" \\\"No, nothing\\\" he replied \\\"I kept listening to try to get a fix on where they were but I could never hear them moving around\\\". \\\"How do you pick up something that big and hurl it into the water seven times without making some noise on the ground?\\\" I ask him. \\\"The lantern and the stream made some noise, we were talking off and on, I don't know.\\\"  he replied. \\\"Did you smell anything\\\"? I ask. \\\"No.\\\" He replied. \\\"Did notice if the nature sounds had ceased?\\\" I asked. \\\"I didn't notice the nature sounds one way or another\\\". He stated. \\\"Did you have any foreboding or erie feelings?\\\" I probed. \\\"Not really, I was more aggravated than anything else.  I was obviously worried and concerned for my family' s safety and tried to maintain my composure throughout the whole ordeal, but when that last object hit the water so close, with such force, it really did scare me a little. I didn' t experience any creepy feelings until we were on our way back to the truck and loading the 4 wheelers.  At that point I did feel the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It felt as is we were being watched, that if I turned around suddenly someone would be there looking at me\\\". John replied. \\\"Did you hear any unusual animal noises at all?\\\" I continued to inquire. His face changed a little and said, \\\"Yes, we did hear something, now that you mention it.  We did hear a strange scream once about 15 minuets after dark, way off in the distance, like a half mile away, upstream. Then again 20 to 30 minuets later, real loud, much closer maybe 200 yards upstream about 10 min. before all of the rock throwing business started\\\". He described the screams as high pitched and approximately 4 to 5 seconds in duration. He could not determine what they were. At that point I was very interested and determined to go out there the next day and have a look around. It rained heavy that night and the next several days and flooded that whole area.  I went out there about two weeks later to look for any sign and came up empty. I'm sure he and/or his wife would talk to you about their experience. I can put you in touch with them if you like. He just don't care enough about what happened it to report it.  I wanted to go ahead and document it just in case someone else might have seen or heard something.\", \"location_details\": \"South of Hwy 150, on Blue River a few miles west of Fredricksburg, IN off of S.

The land consists of a couple of open fields, but is mostly heavily wooded. The blind I was in always has a lot of activity around it. You will see deer, bobcats, armadillos, coyotes, rabbits, all manner of birds, and hogs, lots of ferrell hogs. The blind sets at the end of the road, at the end of the property, in somewhat of a valley. As you exit the woods,the road turns slightly to right and drops down into the \\\"valley\\\". From where the road exits the woods to my blind is at least 700yds or more. The road continues on down to the blind, but when I am hunting, I park my truck and walk to the blind using a small flashlight so as not to disturbed the wildlife. The land opens up from one end of the \\\"valley\\\" to the other. There is about 300yds of fairly open gound from one tree line to the next. My blind sets on NW side at the tree line. As usual, there was a lot of wildlife activity, until about 7AM. All the animals, even the birds, left. Then I started to hear large branches breaking and then something hitting the trees with, I assume, the branches. The blind sets about 12' off the ground, but I never saw anything. I used my scope and binoculars, but the woods are very thick. About 30 minutes after the branch breaking started, a hog ran out of the woods from the direction of the noise and ran into one of the guide wires on my stand (3/8\\\" cable). Very easy to see. It then jumped up, ran into the ladder and then proceeded over the hill. It seemed to be a bit frightened. About an hour later, a branch hit my blind. When that happened,I almost had to change my drawers. The branch breaking and tree pounding kept up for about 2 1/2 hours. When the noise stopped and the wildlife came back, I left. The next morning, I went back to the blind, walking in as usual. About halfway, I could hear something walking with me. It was a little ways inside the brush. At that point, I reached in my hunting bag and got my headlamp and put it on. I put my flashlight up so I could get to my side arm easier. I never wanted to run so bad in my life but thought better of it. Just as I got to my stand, something very close to me made a very deep, grunting growl. That is the only way I can describe the sound. I dropped my hunting bag and went up the ladder into my stand in record time. About daybreak, the events from the previous day began again.

Furthermore, nothing similar has ever been found in the fossil record that I know of so that has lead me to believe it was all false, until this weekend (Nov 24, 2013). I am an avid birdwatcher and wildlife photographer.  I take very long hikes in various wild areas around Tampa this time of year to photograph whatever I find. I was hiking at Cypress Creek Preserve which is in between interstate 275 and 75 near the apex where they meet. I was walking on one of the rather wide trails and I came to a stop because I heard a noise.  I had seen quite a few wild pigs that morning and I thought I could photograph one crossing the trail in front of me.  I was looking down at my camera adjusting the ISO settings and I saw something large move out of the corner of my eye (to my left) approximately 200 feet away. As soon as I saw the movement I looked directly at it and it was already halfway across the trail at this point. My eyes were directly on the animal as it walked, upright, across the rest of the trail and into the palmettos. It was very large (at least 6 feet tall or more) completely black in color with a VERY wide chest from front to back.  It was walking completely upright with a very fast, purposeful pace. The animal was leaning forward slightly but did not seem awkward with its steps - like a bear would be while walking upright. I slowly walked over to the spot where I saw it cross and I could still hear it moving through the woods in the distance.  I immediately noticed that all the birds around me had stopped chirping and the insects had stopped making noise as well.  I looked for tracks or hair left on the plants in the area but found nothing.  I was able to get a picture of the palmetto on the trail where it crossed and I put my tripod near it for a height comparison.

We drove my 4x4 pickup to the ridgeline that divides the St Joe river and North Fork Clearwater river. This is accessible by USFS and BLM roads, the latter of which is generally only open June to September due to the high elevation and snow. The weather at this time was favorable and we chose to sleep in the back of the truck rather than using the tent. We both felt very uneasy after laying in bed for at least an hour. This uneasiness is difficult to describe but we both felt very strange and decided to start the truck and go back down the mountain. The night was clear under a full moon. We were easily able to see the trail without headlights and drove slowly downhill. After only 5 or 10 minutes of travel we rounded a bend in the trail and saw something large ahead of us. I flipped on the headlights and a very large creature seemed to jump off the trail and into the woods moving downhill and to our left. We caught only the briefest glimpse but the creature was easily 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in brown fur. As the creature jumped from the trail it seemed to catch a fir tree which obscured it from our direct line of sight. The tree was about 12 to 14 feet tall and bent tip to ground before springing back up. This all occurred in a matter of seconds. We both said \\\"what the f**k was that?!\\\" I hit the ebrake and got out of the cab with my maglight and my 30/30 rifle. Shining the light through the trees illuminated at least 50 yards clearly as the alpine forest is not very dense except for the huckleberry bushes knee to waist high. I saw nothing and heard nothing.  I couldn't figure how any animal so large could get out of sight so quickly with no sound. No twigs snapping beyond the flashlight or anything. That's when all the hair on my arms and neck stood straight on end. I realized that the creature was laying down in the huckleberry bushes right in front of me. I can't explain as it wasn't visible but I simply knew it was right there. I had the distinct impression that this thing was waiting for me to make the next move. My wife was still in the truck begging me to get back in and leave. She was terrified. Somehow my rifle seemed suddenly impotent. My fear overpowered my curiosity and I got back in the truck and we got away from that area. I have been around moose and bears many times in the woods over the years and never felt frightened but this night I was frightened for sure. The hair on my arms and neck stands on end now writing this nearly 12 years later. I do not believe that creature was a moose or a bear. I can't help thinking that if we hadn't left our camping spot due to our intense feelings of uneasiness and had instead fallen asleep there that the creature we saw would have come upon us within a short time.\", \"location_details\": \"Freezeout saddle, Grandmother mountain area\", \"county\": \"Shoshone County\", \"state\": \"Idaho\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 59472: Husband and wife see large upright figure leap from road around midnight on Freezeout Saddle near Clarkia\", \"latitude\": 47.02242, \"longitude\": -116.0518, \"date\": \"2006-08-07T00:00:00\", \"number\": 59472.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c2m7x0jtmn\", \"temperature_high\": 84.45, \"temperature_mid\": 71.92, \"temperature_low\": 59.39, \"dew_point\": 40.52, \"humidity\": 0.35, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.43, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 19.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.39, \"location\": \"POINT(-116.0518 47.022420000000004)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I HAVE AN AUDIO TAPE OF THIS EVENT, IT HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD BY ANYONE OTHER THAN A FEW NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS AROUND THE TIME THIS HAPPENED.   It was a fall evening, I was doing homework at our trailer, which was 1/2 mile from where my dad was building our house. He would get home from work around 4:00 and work out there till 10. One evening he came flying out the road in his truck and pulled in the driveway, then ran to the trailer asking my mom for the tape recorder. I was curious and asked him what was going on, he said that there was something in the valley fighting with a dog. So I grabbed my coat and wanted to go see, he let me go with him, but told me to stay in the truck, I didn't listen and tried to follow him. So he told me to stand by the cows feed trough, which was near the house at top of field. He grabbed a wooden club and put the tape recorder in his shirt pocket and started walking down the hill towards the noise. I remember that when this creature growled, it shook the ground where I was standing, about 200 yards away. I was scared, and even more scared for my dad, who was now about half way to it. Another weird thing was that the 6 head of cattle we had were standing head to head in a circle at the edge of the woods. It took my dad about 5 minutes to get to the woods, where this creature was fighting a dog, you can hear the leaves crunching under every step he took. But when he got nearer it was too dark in the wooded valley for him to see the creature. So he returned back up the hill. The entire time that the recorder was on, you can hear this earth moving growl along with a dog fighting with it. Oddly, our neighbors dog (HENRY), who came around a lot, was never seen or heard from again. My dad wouldn't let me go near that valley for a while, but eventually I was allowed to go down there.  And when I did, I looked around the area I heard the battle, and found a bunch of deer hair and bones scattered around a 20 foot area, But no (HENRY). Back when this happened I was about 8-10 years old, and didn't think of looking for hair samples or DNA, or even footprints. Looking back, I wish I would have thought of all that stuff. But I do still have the tape recording, I really want someone from the BFRO to take this tape and get it transferred to digital. Everyone of our neighbors listened to this tape, and no one can say what it is for sure. I told my cousin about this event a few weeks after it happened, and her eyes got big and told me that one of her friends and her mom seen some big creature walking through a field below their house.

We heard the rustling of trees and shrubs about 10 yards downhill of us. Then the most guttural, loud, and high pitched yell erupted from the trees below. We hunt all of the time and have never heard anything like that. To this day we cannot pin it down to any known animal in this region. It wasn't an elk as it didn't bugle. It wasn't the cry of a mountain lion, and certainly wasn't a bear. The sheer decibel level of the sound indicated to me that it was a rather large animal. We looked at each other and ran to that truck about a mile away. We never looked back, we were too scared. An interesting thing happened about five months ago. I rented a bigfoot documentary which had a recording some campers had made in Washington State somewhere in the summer of 1971.

My friend was in front and I was about 20 feet behind him chopping what he had missed. As I got to a big patch he missed, I stopped and started chopping away as my friend kept walking. The ditch was to my back now. Suddenly, I felt like someone was behind me. I turned around and was pretty much face to face with a bigoot. It was about eight feet away from me. My guess is it was sleeping or hiding in the ditch and just stood up to see what was going on. It could have reached out and grabed me with no trouble. I think it was just as surprised to see me as I was to see it. It was standing in a ditch so it wasn't towering over me, but it was still taller than me.

Our destination was Granite Lake, two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination, had lunch and were returning, following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond, about 1/3rd of the way back, I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond, to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake, and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me, so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking, trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense, and generally well covered with pine needle duff, generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk, I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed, as there were no signs of previous travel, and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour, but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes, I realized that I wasn't going to find the lake, so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route, trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human, except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes, and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature, and left a deeper impression, especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch, and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points, indicating that one creature was directly following the other, stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead. It had snowed two days before, and the ground was damp, but most of the snow had melted.

My brother In Law Dan, told me of his experience after I told him that I reported mine to BFRO! Dan's story goes like this: He had gone up to visit some people camping in a trailer. As he arrived and turned off his motorcycle engine, he observed something dark in color moving on an open hillside below a timber line. There was snow on the ground, it was getting towards dusk and it was a little foggy.The thing was two hundred and fifty yards away approximately. As Dan observed this thing, he noticed it was quite tall, seven feet or more in height. This thing let Dan know that he saw Dan by looking back directly at Dan, as he continued walking uphill towards the timber. He looked back at Dan several times without breaking his stride. His stride was long, longer than a man's, and was effortless as he walked through the snow. Dan thought, what kind of a man would be wearing a dark hairy suite that covered his entire body, out in the forest? Dan also noticed that this thing was much bigger than any man he has seen and it's build was very big! Dan felt it could weigh a good six hundred pounds or so. This creature disappeared into the timber. Dan knew he had seen something very unusual and he was aware of Big Foot sightings in the news. He just let his story go all these years until I am now reporting it to you. \", \"location_details\": \"Will need to talk to Dan to get the details, he can give them to you.\", \"county\": \"Chelan County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 2070: Two men see something walk up and over ridge behind home\", \"latitude\": 47.35305, \"longitude\": -120.2955, \"date\": \"2004-10-17T00:00:00\", \"number\": 2070.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c26mqs77x8\", \"temperature_high\": 49.13, \"temperature_mid\": 44.69, \"temperature_low\": 40.25, \"dew_point\": 44.76, \"humidity\": 0.92, \"cloud_cover\": 0.88, \"moon_phase\": 0.13, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0157, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 993.41, \"summary\": \"Rain in the morning and afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 9.35, \"wind_bearing\": 321.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.76, \"location\": \"POINT(-120.2955 47.35305)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was driving at night on I-25 on raton pass.

It is predominately wooded for the few miles drive into New Gretna. As I approached the overpass of the parkway, we both noticed this man-like creature standing alongside the guardrail.  My mother said, \\\"What the hell is that?\\\" I had the same thought! Here stood this man-like creature approximately 7' tall, covered with hair from head to foot.  It's head was hairy also, except for the areas surrounding the eyes, cheeks and mouth. It appeared grayish in color from the headlights. In a split second, it turned its head and looked right at us.  At the same time, it lifted its left leg over the guardrail and disappeared down into the darkness of the woods. My mother wanted me to turn around and go back,  I was too shocked and scared to. The fact we were two women alone on this dark road, was not a good idea. I did however, go back to that very same spot the next morning to see if there was anything there to prove further what we had seen.

It had been a cold, snowy day, and I had gone to bed rather early (around 8 pm.). I awakened at 2:30 and got up to look out the bedroom window, through the curtains, just to check on the weather, see if stars were out, etc. I noticed that the basement lights were still on in the rather large, two-story 3-bedroom family cabin. This cabin was about 75 yards directly SE of my cabin (in back of me). I assumed the lights were still on since children may have been playing games that night, and simply forgot to turn out the lights. I looked out the window of about a half minute with this thought on my mind. I didn't see any movement inside the cabin basement, so I assumed the family had retired for the evening. Just as I was about to close the curtain, I saw a very tall, rather large, dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement, across the snow. The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined. It did not waiver. It did not rush. The figure had long legs, and was mostly all legs. Its torso was solid and straight. It did not look human, I did not discern any clothing on it. I was puzzled at first, thinking, \\\"Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather, walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side, which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away). There were no other lights on at the time, but the snow held its own illumination in the dark. The basement back-lighting created the perfect silhouette for the striding figure. I only saw it swing its arms, it was not carrying anything. After I watched it pass, I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot. i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident. The image remained in my mind for a good while, so I got up and checked all the locks on the doors, just to feel more safe, since I was staying alone in the cabin. Auditory (Vocalization episode) The next day was especially snowy, almost like a white out. The snow was VERY thick and it was easy to get stuck, as the YMCA plows were working as hard and fast as they could to clear the narrow roads throughout the campus. It was very difficult to pass safely down some of the roads. I had just come out of the Mootz Crafts Center, and had gotten my car stuck. I was fortunate that some kind male guests spotted me getting stuck and helped to push my car out of a snow bank. They left quickly and went back inside the lodge nearby. The snow was falling quickly and heavily, and I was beginning to worry I might get stuck again. I was standing outside my car, trying to determine the best driving route to take, when all of a sudden from the back of the woods, nearby what I would determine was the Livery Stables, came a very loudly projected guttural (like from the deep part of the back of a throat) type of cry-moan. It lasted several seconds (about 4 seconds or so). I looked around to see if I could see anyone, but no one was out at all. The weather was far too severe. I stood by my car, opened the car-door, which made a squeak, and the sound uttered once again, almost exactly as it had the first time. Same loudly projected quality, carrying from somewhere back deep in the nearby woods. This time, I felt intimated and frightened. This sound did not match the sound of an elk, or a mountain lion or a person, or a kid being silly. \\\"The bears are all asleep,\\\" I thought. The message that I perceived from it was \\\"I am here. I can see you. This is my territory.\\\" I quickly got into my car, closed the door and managed to pull away out of the deep snow, leaving the YMCA campus. it was a very eerie experience,and I can still feel the chill going up my spine as I think of the impact of those howls on that very snowy day.\", \"location_details\": \"Both incidents occurred on the YMCA Campus located in Estes Park.\", \"county\": \"Larimer County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 44401: YMCA camp guest has a possible nighttime sighting and hears strange vocalizations in Estes Park\", \"latitude\": 40.33838, \"longitude\": -105.5728, \"date\": \"2014-02-09T00:00:00\", \"number\": 44401.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9xhvmxkhp7\", \"temperature_high\": 25.4, \"temperature_mid\": 20.355, \"temperature_low\": 15.31, \"dew_point\": 19.1, \"humidity\": 0.95, \"cloud_cover\": 0.99, \"moon_phase\": 0.34, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0002, \"precip_probability\": 0.21, \"precip_type\": \"snow\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Foggy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 3.0, \"visibility\": 1.57, \"wind_bearing\": 230.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.13, \"location\": \"POINT(-105.5728 40.33838)\"}, {\"observed\": \"About 10 years ago, in the Upper Peninsula of MI in pine and hardwoods country (mixed) I was riding my white gelding, SILVER just before dusk.  I was about 1 1/2 miles from my camp, when Silver stopped dead in his tracks on the dirt road we were on, and stared into the woods.  I looked in the direction his head was turned and to my surprise, I saw a tall white animal coming towards us at a quick speed.  It almost looked like my horse, coming at us!  IF I wasn't riding him at the time, I would have thought he got lost and it was him running towards me.  All of a sudden, the animal came within about 30 yards from us, stopped and turned to go sideways... running behind some pine trees.  HE just disappeared!!!  I didn't see him come out of the other side, go back, nothing. JUST GONE.  I was quite scared at the time, and real excited, too.  I was too scared to go into the woods to find where it went, or what it was for that matter.  I had white hair, looked like a horse standing tall, looking at me, but when it turned sideways, to run, there was no large body behind it.  IT looked like an upright animal running.  IT was totally silent, with no noises even though he was running through the trees, and in a very heavey blue berry patch area.  THE area has since been logged off in that stretch, and I know my kids saw something running in the woods the same summer while 4-wheeling.  We made a big joke about our albino sasquatch, and to this day, I do believe I saw something real remarkable.  I tell my story, and they laugh at me, but I know what I saw, and my horse saw it too.  HIS reaction was quite extraordinary.  I think what ever the animal was, it thought Silver was one of them.  HE looked so similar in the woods, til he turned and there was no body behind it.  I never reported it to any officials here as there isn't anyone to report it to.  Thought of calling the DNR about it, but I swear my family teases me terrible so I know I would get ridiculed about it if I went too public.  Everyone at camp knows of this though and I do tell it often.  I know it was something unique for me to witness.  We have a large wooded area in the U.P. where our camp is, with very rugged terrain.  Many bluffs are located in this area, and one large ridge runs behind where the animal was observed.  I have not seen this since that summer, and no one other than my children and their friends have reported any such sightings that I know of.  It has always bothered me I didn't go and investigate further.  BUT the primal fear I felt in me was something I have never dealt with and I just couldn't do it.  I don't know if this is worth telling you now, since the area was logged and it was so many years ago, but I guess I am wondering if anyone else has ever reported anything so bizarre... especially it being all white like that.\", \"location_details\": \"17 M north of Ishpeming, off Deer Lake Road turning R after Steel bridge on Big Dead river\", \"county\": \"Marquette County\", \"state\": \"Michigan\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 2787: Horseback rider has close range sighting in jackpine forest\", \"latitude\": 46.61183, \"longitude\": -87.73236, \"date\": \"1991-08-01T00:00:00\", \"number\": 2787.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"f0395t7jxf\", \"temperature_high\": 77.72, \"temperature_mid\": 65.095, \"temperature_low\": 52.47, \"dew_point\": 47.97, \"humidity\": 0.54, \"cloud_cover\": 0.25, \"moon_phase\": 0.69, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1012.82, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 8.0, \"visibility\": 9.83, \"wind_bearing\": 276.0, \"wind_speed\": 8.71, \"location\": \"POINT(-87.73236 46.61183)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My husband and I are visiting family in Sandy Hook. On the evening of the 18th, at about 7:30, we got in the car to make a quick run to Sandy Hook. It was very cold, (it was already dark as well), so he started up the car to let it warm before we took off. As we were waiting, he called his grandmother -- because of the call time on his phone, we know what time this all occurred. While he was talking to her, his low fuel light came on, and they wrapped up the call at 7:45. We pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He was going a little faster than normal because we were a little nervous we'd run out of gas if we dilly-dallied too much. As we got into the curve about a quarter of a mile from my mom's house, I spotted something in the hollow ahead of us. It was almost out of the range of his headlights, and by my calculations, about 75-100 feet away from us. Now this all happened very very quickly, but because I am observant, especially when it comes to spotting deer crossing the road, I was able to make this observation within a couple of seconds. What I saw first was presumably an animal standing on the edge of the opposite lane. I leaned forward and scrutinized closer. Just before I could scream out, \\\"DEER IN THE ROAD!\\\" the creature began to walk very quickly, and at that moment I realized it had two legs, not four. At some point I started screaming, \\\"Turn on your brights! There's something in the road!\\\" All the while, I'm looking at this thing which is very big in stature, thick legs, thick abdomen, and (again by my calculations) at least 7 ft tall. It was the color of a tree, specifically the trees in that area, so like a grayish-brown, very earthy-tone. The area where I assume a face would be was lighter in color, but I couldn't tell what color. I know this because it turned its head and looked straight at our car. My husband saw movement and he saw what he described as a strange shadow, but he did not see the creature. Only I saw the creature, and in fairly good detail. Again, it happened so quickly though, I didn't get to see feet, hands or facial details like eyes and mouth. One thing I thought was interesting was the direction it was coming from. It was coming from a very tall and steep mountain, and when it hurried across the road, it must have gone off a very steep cliff, as that is the only place it could have gone. This cliff drops off onto Pruetts Fork Road, which is also very wooded and secluded. After we came back from our errand, we drove slowly and tried to inspect the area, but came up empty handed. That night, the neighborhood dogs were behaving very strangely, barking and howling all night long. One of them even acted as if he could see something in the distance, and began to growl and stalk before he took off to chase it.

We drove to a spot that we had just found a few days before. We parked are truck up on top of a ridge and hiked down a draw that leads into a canyon. I started down to a sidehill above the draw while my dad and brother headed down the draw. After being seperate from each other for about 15 minutes I was up above the draw a ways, and I was standing there looking around the hillsides when I heard a kind of moaning howling sound which to me at that time sounded like a man yelling \\\"help\\\"very slowly and weakly like they were hurt. So I started to head back down into the draw to make sure it wasnt someone needing help. About 30 seconds went by and I heard it again so I stopped to listen I heard it a little louder this time since I was farther down the draw. This time I had a very weird feeling go through me I felt uneasy and almost a scared sensation but I still thought it was someone yelling \\\"help\\\". I eventually met up whith my dad and brother and asked if they had heard that yelling sound they said yes and that it was very close to them which they thought sounded more like an angry moaning sound and then heard a pop about as loud as a 22 rifle but it wasnt a rifle.

We asked them to show us, in which they were both agreed after the calmed down a bit. we left there car and took my Aunts van and headed north, they showed us the spot and i marked by throwing out a full water bottle and I asked them which way do you think it was going and if they seen more, she said that \\\"it might of been moving West\\\", so we headed West bound on Country Rd. 6 just North of White Shield as we headed about 1-2miles west from Country Rd. 7 we turned North bound on Country Rd. 5 as we were spotlighting in the cut Wheat Fields. I was on the passenger side and my Uncle was driving we were both looking around with the lights when I picked up a bright RED reflection of eyes, as i told my Uncle to stop i notice that this thing was on all fours  moving west towards us and then it stop and what looked like it sat down, i mean it looked like a gorrilla from the movies. As we stoped and sat there we must of been watching it for about 3-5mins, It seemed unreal to me but as i started to realize that this is happing and that we don't have gorrilla's in North Dakota that is when my Uncle notice two more sets of eyes behind the one we were watching, my cousins started screaming and cussing at us to leave and to get the Cops and Game & Fish, so after that we started to turn around and head back in i noticed it stood up that's when i said hurry up lets get Game & Fish out here. When i arrived at my house my cousin called the BIA and they said they will contact the Game Warden. My Uncle and I told my cousin to tell them that we are going to go back out there and wait for the Game Warden, my cousins stayed. My cousin husband wanted to go with us. As we started to turn on country Rd. 5 thats when we noticed the smell of pee and old sweet and slew odor, it wasn't us because i checked the smell inside that van and it smelled better then the  outside. We stoped and jumped out and started to listen, thats when we noticed the truck lights on Country Rd. 6 it was the Game Warden. We flashed him down and talked to him and gave all the info so he said he will check the field out and left moving East with all his spotlights on. As we talked my Uncle said \\\"try to call it\\\" so my cousin husband made a howling sound and sure enough another sound came back a faint bellow South West of us about 1/2-1mi. There is no cattle around there so we started to head in that direction and stoped where we thought the sound was at. we had the windows down and started to listen for any sound, there was none not even crickets or birds or grasshoppers chirping so we turned around and left, stoped Game Warden and we stated looking untill 7am that morning, we noticed that there were lots of slew and deep weeds a place for a good hiding spot. On the next day we started looking for prints and we found some impressions in the cut wheat field and ditch, the prints were close to 15 1/5 inches and about 5 1/2 - 6 inches wide. We stoped a BIA officer and told him that we found some imprssions so he came out there and took some pictures, the foot prints pointed in a East direction as we started to track them we found 3 other sets that seemed like they were zigziging around, after an 30min or so we track it to a tree row where it seemed that there were spots of cut hay put into piles and pine tree branches 2in thick snaped off, the sap still ozzing out from the break, and sunflower or tall weeds stems in that spot, there was no tall weeds around that spot, so we walked around and found a slew just at the end of the tree row about 200yards away, had the same stems from the weeds. On the 31st of Aug my Uncle and I kinda made a path of direction, it looks like they follow slews and small ponds maybe for drinking water. The direction was taking them to Lake Sakakawea, has we tested taht theory we were West of White Shield when we heard a low scream, a dog that lived at a farm house started to bark. Where the spot we seen it and to the location where we heard it, are theory was correct. On Sept 4 since we left them alone for a couple of days we went to the spot where we thought the would be at.. NO Luck they weren't there so that was the end of the search or hunt, until Sept 9 when 6 kids saw a tall black thing running on two legs heading West on BIA 1 just 1/2mi North of White Shield, I talked to the kids and the said when it was running in the field it was black and on two legs and as it crossed the road it took 3 steps and it was on the other side. This was around 9pm and the sun was setting. By the time the kids told it was dark, my Uncle and I drove back there and found nothing, the next day Sept 10 we tried to find the path where this thing or big foot crossed, we are still looking for signs or even better prints.

My friend and I were sitting in the car planning for the next day. The engine was running but the lights were off. After several minutes of planning and laughing around, I was ready to head into the house. There are no lights around the house and no moon, so it was pretty dark out there. So my friend turned his headlights on so I could see my way to the front door. As soon as the car lights came on, this HUGE, slender built man went sprinting across the back yard! He was HUMUNGOUS... His head must of been right at the level of the corner of the house. He ran so fast, my mind wasn't sure my eyes had seen what they thought they did. I asked my friend \\\"Did you see that?\\\" He, of course, was occupied with his stereo and missed it. I said good night and went on in the house. I kept playing the scene over and over in my mind.

Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch. I was staying at a place called Mariner Village about 5 miles south of Ocean Shores. It's about 1/4 mile from the north jetty at Browns Pt. The time is about 1:30am (I knew this because I had just left my room at 1:20 am to return to my fire on the beach). My back was to the ocean watching the fire. I turned to look at the ocean (which was about 30 yards away) and saw what I thought was a person walking south along the water line down the beach. The moon was full and when I first saw it, it was directly west of me. What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area. It appeared to be just a person out for a late night/early morning stroll on the beach. So I decide to follow them, maybe go talk to them and start walking at an angle down the beach to cut them off. Seeing that I wasn't catching up to them I start running down the beach still at an angle in there direction. It was hard to make out detail while running so I stopped to get a better look. That's when I realized the following, with the full moonlight I could see only it's upper body and it was all black, it had no neck, looked like it was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I start running again as fast as I could. This thing was fast, it must have covered the 1/4 mile from where I first saw it down to about 50 yards from the jetty in about a minute and a half. I stop running and I could see it way down the beach about 200 yards away. It stopped about 50 yards from the jetty turned and faced the ocean. It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves. It's movements seemed very unnatural and overexagerated. When it turned towards the ocean it flexed it's back like it was leaning backwards. It seemed like it was looking back to see where I was. I know it saw me standing by the fire, I had a white t-shirt on and a shaved head, and probably saw me go after it, that's why it got down the beach so fast. It moved off and when it got near the shadow of the jetty I lost sight of it. That's when I decided to turn around and go back. Tried to find tracks but it was moving along the water line at high tide, the waves would have covered them up. The next day I took my friend told him to go stand down by the water and stood in the spot I first saw it, I could barely see the top of his head. Like I said I didn't report this for awhile because it's hard to fathom this happening in such a populated area. But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness. Once it got to that jetty it leads to the game refuge.

My room mate had given us directions to a waterfall in a little-known back road park on the edge of Tuscawaras and Stark Counties. His directions weren't so great, and we couldn't find the place and ended up in the small town of Winesburg. After looking around we decided to head back, however we decided to \\\"get lost\\\" for some fun and took a couple of turns without noticing any street names. We eventually found ourselves on a class two state highway in Dundee, OH area. Heading north we passed a state gameland office on the left, and I started looking for a parking area to take a hike. I'm an avid hunter, and love the wildlife area's here in Ohio as they normally have nice trails and roads to hike around on. We came up on a set of railroad tracks from the south, and right before the tracks on the left there was a small one lane dirt road. It was marked as state game land, so I turned down it. It went down a hill, skirted along a swampy region, and then turned west a bit. The parking area was about 3/4 of a mile to a mile from the main road I'd say, and the road continued on past the parking area but there were signs saying no vehicles were allowed past that point. At the time we were the only ones there and got out to take a walk. We started out on the road past the parking area. It took us to the railroad tracks, and we crossed them. The road continued on from there, and took a small branch in the road. We first went right, and hiked a while. This branch of the road went towards the swamp, and was quite overgrown. We never really stopped to listen, but eventually turned around and took the fork in the road that went higher up the hill away from the swamp. This led to a very overgrown field, and we skirted along the West edge along the woods and along the edge of the hill that overlooked the swamp. At the end of the field, I decided to walk into the woods and stop and listen just to observe what was around, as I usually do when hunting. This is when it happened.  Across the swamp about 150 yards, we heard three loud evenly spaced knocks on what sounded to be a rather large tree. They occurred about three knocks in two seconds, I'd say. A couple of seconds later we heard three more knocks from what seemed a larger distance, probably 250 yards or more. After a short pause I brought my girlfriend's attention to the sounds. At that time we heard three more large knocks from in front of us, followed by three more louder knocks from the left. At this point, three knocks came from our right from across the body of the swamp. The water I'm sure obscured my judgment of distance, but with that in consideration now I'd say they were maybe 200 yards away. At this time, we heard four louder knocks from in front of us, then three to our left. At this time I felt uncomfortable enough to say I wanted to get out of there. After walking at a high rate of speed out of the area for a few hundred yards, I felt we were out of danger. My love for trains took over, and we walked for a 100 yards or so up the tracks to the south through a large rock cut and back to the path. We headed back to the car, and came across a puddle and I was showing my girlfriend a frog when all of a sudden the sounds came back. I don't know if whatever created the sounds on the far side of the swamp had moved, or if what we had perceived as the sound coming from our right was now in front of us.  In any case, we heard three more knocks from straight across the swamp from us, and then three more from our right again across the swamp. Distance was too hard to judge as we immediately started heading for the car. I knew there was a swamp in between us but I didn't like sticking around. On the way out we crossed paths with two hunters in camo and armed with bows. I said hello, but didn't bother mentioning the sounds as at the time I hadn't thought much about it. During the whole incident the thought of the possibility of Bigfoot crossed my mind, but I didn't let it stay long. Afterwards, while thinking about what happened, I said something to my girlfriend about how strange the sounds were, and that maybe it was Bigfoot. She shockingly agreed, saying she had seen TV reports of similar instances involving Bigfoot. I must admit a history of being very interested in Bigfoot as a whole, but never have I experienced something like this. I know of no animal that communicates like this. We both agree that it seemed like communication, either to us or to each other. The sounds seemed too big for humans to make, and the knocking was quite deep in pitch, indicating a larger sized tree. On return my room mate said he had indeed heard stories of people having encounters in that area, and I immediately turned here.

I have not told anyone outside of friends about my experience, although there were plenty of others around at the time. This encounter happened, Ohhh bout 30 years ago in Columbus, MS. I and several of the neighborhood kids were out playing in my front yard. I was the oldest, so the rest of the dozen or so kids were 4th grade and earlier in school. All of us were playing \\\"Tag\\\" and to make things level-out for the younger kids, we all were turning round and round to get dizzy so the youngers could have a fighting chance of  catching us. All of a sudden, my youngest brother ran through the group yelling \\\"Booger-Bear!!\\\" He looked TOTALLY scared to death. I thought he was joking, but then my next brother did the same while pointing toward the unoccupied side of out duplex apartment house. Soon, I looked around to find that I was the only one left in my front yard, the rest of the kids had run to where the parents where outside chatting next door. All of them were holding onto his/her parent(s). Well, I looked down the street and saw nothing unusual. Looked again, both ways, same result. As I was turning back toward them, my eye caught a movement beside my duplex. Something was standing at the corner, hugging it as though to peek around a corner. It appeared to be slightly hunched over and yet the top of it's head was at the top of the window. The top of that window was at about the 7ft plus level. Could have been higher. One day I might get a chance to measure it cause the house is still there today, although the neighborhood is not where I would care to be at anytime nowdays. Anyway, I stood there looking, trying to figure out what this white hairy thing was. Earlier in the year, maybe a couple of months (been a long time ago), there was a report of a white gorilla that had escaped from a circus. Thing is, kids know when a circus is around in those days, and I had never heard of one being anywhere near. It was just standing there, slightly moving kind of side to side. Since it was at dusk, and I couldn't really tell what this was that I was looking at, I slowly backed over to the grown-ups area. Eventually, the thing was hidden from my view by the house. I eventually worked up enough courage to make a wide arc toward where I saw it to see if it was still there. Nope, it was gone. I had a terrible time sleeping that night. Didn't want to be anywhere near a window even though we had no AC and it was warm weather. Next morning, I went to the area just to see if I could find anything. Nothing. I was never late for supper again. Never stayed out after dark. etc...The experience is real, though I have questioned my brothers about it and they remember nothing. Perhaps it was the grownups playing a joke?  They of course deny any knowledge.

I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built. Pete was already asleep... I was trying to sleep but couldn't so I was poking the fire with a long stick.  I heard something coming down the hill (heard rustling leaves, etc) but figured it was deer coming down the game trail.  It is tough to tell where sounds come from at night and judge distance in the woods because it's so quiet.... but I figured it was pretty far out (about 150 or 200 yds) moving to our left.  I heard some sort of popping sound like the trunk of a tree being hit with something solid or two 2x4s being smacked together and a few growls (kinda like a lion but higher pitched, kinda like a stomach growling)... I still didn't really pay any attention.  I dismissed the popping as trees cracking and the growling to Petes stomach or a low volume snore.  Whatever this thing was, it circled our camp keeping the same distance away.  All I heard was the rustle of leaves or twig snaps.  I kept hearing the popping sound occasionnally but I still wasn't freaked out.  The sound eventually stopped basically where it I started hearing it.  I starting thinking that whatever it was, it was a predator (showing stalking behavior)... I figured it was a bear, fox, or some other predator/scavenger that thought it was a good idea to leave us alone.  But then I started getting a really creepy feeling that I was being watched.  I thought my mind was playing tricks and I was imagining it...  but it got worse and worse.  I couldn't hear anything definitive in the woods but was still getting creeped out. I could only see part of the woods because only part of our shelter is open... but I started looking around (from my bag inside the shelter, not walking around) and what I could see was lit up pretty well because of the full moon (after the lunar eclipse anyway).  I looked into a stand of trees and saw a really big dark spot... it looked like a broken off tree trunk darkened by shadow... in basically the same spot where the noises stopped.  I looked around the woods a little more and came back to the  same spot where I saw the tree looking thing... and IT WAS GONE!!  I woke Pete up so I could tell him what was going on... and so I would know I wasn't crazy if I heard something again.  I was telling him what was going on when we heard the popping/thudding sound again... He loaded his gun (Pete has a permit to carry a handgun in NY). We got out of our bags and restoked the fire and I heard his stomach growl... really loud!!  He said, \\\"Man you must be hungry.\\\"  I said I thought that was his stomach and we just looked at each other.  We went to investigate where I saw the disappearing shadow thing and we made a lot of noise to scare off whatever it was (breaking branches, kicking at the leaves, talking/yelling to each other).  We looked around the woods a bit... I heard something up on the ridge keeping pace with us but moving away.  It didn't run, just moved away from us at the rate we were moving toward it.  We stayed up for a little while longer and heard nothing so we went back to bed.  Pete was out like a light and I stayed awake just listening. About 30 minutes later, THE THING CAME BACK!! I woke Pete up as I heard it come down off the hill from the same direction it started from... it was making a truck load of noise banging trees (we think it actually pushed one over too). It growled a few times,  and it's foot steps were really heavy... based upon how Pete and I sounded moving through the woods earlier, this thing had to weigh much more than both of us (I'm 6'2\\\" and 250lbs).  It came in on our left and walked behind our camp about 30-50 yds... We couldn't see it because it was on the non-open side of our shelter and we didn't want to pop out and provoke an attack.  It kept walking in the same direction and eventually was out of earshot but we figured that was enough of a warning. We packed up and went back to the cabin. There are many screwed up things about this.  First, I've been hunting for years and I don't get spooked... Pete is ex-military and no slouch in the woods either.  But this spooked us bad enough to make us want to pack up the gear at two in the morning (leaving some of it on the hill) and come back to the cabin.  Second, two of us heard this thing so I know its not just my mind playing tricks on me... it was definitely there!!  Third, this thing was massive... It made a whole bunch of noise when it walked behind our camp (more than any animal I have ever heard) and it's footsteps almost shook the ground.  But here comes the most screwed up part of the story.  I have hunted for 15+ years and know what animals sound like coming through the woods... I have heard deer, bear, fox, etc... just about any animal in NJ, NY, PA, and ME... and, ofc ourse, other hunters.  I can tell you with 100% certainty...  THIS THING WAS WALKING ON TWO FEET!! I checked the area the next day and found a large foot print in soft earth... about 3 inches longer than mine and about 2 inches wider (I wear a size 12).  I tracked the animal (or whatever) for a few hundred yards but only found one other definate track and it was the same size roughly.  I also found a dead tree that was knocked to the ground probably the night before (fresh earth on the roots, leaves under/around it disturbed)...

Behind me is a LARGE picture window looking out onto a neighbors field and beyond that is Warehouser land. As I was playing with my back turned to the window. I had a \\\"Someones watching me feeling\\\" I turned around and there, approximately 10 feet in front of me,watching me play piano, is this hairy creature. He was taller than the picture window because he was bending to see in. His arms were long, his eyes were reddish brown as was his hair. It became darker on his main body, but was lighter on his face and chest area. His upper body was pretty buff. It took me a while to scream as I was frozen in fear for a bit but when I did finally scream he took off. My dad ran out and saw the back of it running away. my grandparents and sisters in brother saw it run by the camper and then dad saw it run through our field to the creek.So that's 6 people that saw it.

(It was Summer) The truck was parked a little away from our house by the barn. We were both in bed talking and suddenly the light from the house was blocked out. I saw a face in the topper side window looking at us. At first I thought it was one of my siblings but as my eyes adjusted to the light change I realized it was the hairy face I had seen in the picture window months before. I then froze and whispered to my friend also not to move. It watched for what seemed like an eternity. Maybe waiting for us to move,which we didn't! Then it moved towards the open back gate window, to our Horror. I thought it was coming to get us,but it never showed up back there. When we got up the courage to get out and go to my house. We told everyone what had happened. They had all been together watching a movie. No one there had been away from the rest.Those are my 2 accounts.

We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck. After a few minutes we started hearing movement again in the bushes. We stayed aware but didn't overreact like before. After about 6 minutes, something hit the truck. We flipped on out light bar and got out to see what it was. There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck. It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement. Then as we were still outside, I saw the same stick fly out of nearby bushes and hit the hood of the truck. That's when we knew that we had to leave. This had all of us very upset and honestly frightened for our lives. At first I was open to the idea of a \\\"Bigfoot\\\" but after this night, I was convinced.

From New Waverly driving east on SH150, turning on to FM  1725, one and \\u00bc mile in the Hillcrest Subdivision on Gale Haven Road. Gale Haven Road is a little road curves and it runs next to our property goes down to a dry creek bed as you come up out of the creek bed the road started to curve again in sort of an S shape. The weather was cool and sunny there were thick woods on both side of road. On the passenger side there was a dip for runoff and the property was fenced, the owner has longhorns on that property but the property was wooded.  On the driver side the woods were very thick and there was a deeper runoff, there were downed trees on the edge and no fence.   The fastest you could drive on this road was about 20-25 mph. I was driving a 1993 Saturn that was a standard transmission, I had let my daughter sit in the back with both of her friends and they were being laughing and talking enjoying the last few minutes before I took them home 20 miles away. They were around 15 at the time, I had to have them home by 12:00 noon thats why I remember the time.  At this location I can see our property in my rear view mirrow. As I came out of the dip the road curves to the passenger side and before the road curves to the other side.  I am facing the road and looking into the thicket ahead,  and  60 to 80 feet from my car in the thicket I see what I first thought was the haunches of a horse moving around I could only see the top part.  What I saw had shinny reddish hair and was like 7 to 8 feet high.    Then I remembered I didn\\u2019t see a tail.  As I go up this curve toward this thing I start to look at it a little closer and then this thing, that I thought was a horse, turns around and looks straight at me then crouches down and tries to hide behind a little tree and it\\u2019s sitting there looking at me.  The only thing that I clearly remember is that the eyes were big and black.  The expression on it\\u2019s face was surprise and the eyes followed me and I drove within 15 to 20 feet of it, as I drove by I turned my head and looked out the window.  I did see it in a crouched position and its head looking in my direction.  I don\\u2019t remember skin color and I looked  to see it crouching there, big thick arms, legs and a look of surprise.  I couldn\\u2019t have been driving more than 15 mph and I did not stop, I kept going. I honestly do not know what I would have done if it had sprang to its feet (I get scared really easy). I was so scared that I didn\\u2019t even stop at the stop sign and I was also scared I would flood the car since it was a standard.  The girls looked up and I couldn\\u2019t talk and I was finally able to talk I asked them if they had seen anything and they said no and I told them I thought I had seen something in the woods, then  I decided not to describe what I saw, I told them  it was nothing.  But I did see something there and it saw me.  If I had persisted with my daughter, she would have gone nuts, we would have never been able to live there ever again.  Later that day I told my husband about it and he didn\\u2019t believe me.   He started telling me he saw a ghost dressed in blue in the front yard when he went to work in the mornings.  So I didn\\u2019t mention it again. He would ask me about it from time to time and I stuck to my story and he stuck to his. After that I didn\\u2019t go into the woods anymore.  We had 2 \\u00bd acres, we had cleared about 1 acre of our land and I wanted to clear all of it.  I used to work to clear little by little, my husband stopped helping me because the more I cleared the more he had to mow.   I didn\\u2019t like the woods that close to the house I wanted to see what was out there. Needless to say, my clearing days ended after that. I started closing the curtains at night, put lights all around the house.  When I drove home I would turn on the high beams to make insure that there was nothing out there on our property. Our land was not fenced.  And I know what is out there deer, hogs, I have chased billy goats and those longhorns out of my yard before and I know what they look like up close.  We now live in west Texas since 2007, and I have no regrets. We were located at the top of a little hill, the back part of our subdivision is lower and there are creeks and ponds in the back, and there were some parts that have really thick woods.   About a mile down FM 1725 there is another road called Dabney Bottoms that when it rains a lot, that road floods bad, you cannot drive thru there, even the road is unpaved thru that part.  Another 2 miles down the road on FM 1725 the Sam Houston National Forest starts, my husband use to hunt there, he said there was places on the Dabney Bottoms side of the forest that were really deep and very thick that you almost couldn\\u2019t hunt there.  He also said he had been in an area back there where he come across a place that smelled really bad and it looked like a place where several big things slept there, all the brush was flattened out. He just remembered smelling that smell at other times and always wondered what that was. I started asking the neighbors and they said they started getting their chickens killed or missing but they thought it was a skunk or fox.  I never even considered that it would have been a bigfoot, never entered my mind.  Then one day in February of 2009 my husband asked me to describe what I had seen a long time ago.  Then he asked me to read some of the articles on a bigfoot website and the same fear came over me and couldn\\u2019t believe other people were describing what I saw back then.\", \"location_details\": \"Driving East from New Waverly, Texas about 7 miles on SH 150, then left on FM 1725 go 1 1/2 miles on the left is Hillcreek Subdivision, turn right on Gale Haven Road passed Sandy Creek Rd.\", \"county\": \"San Jacinto County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 28873: Motorist recounts daylight sighting on her property east of New Waverly\", \"latitude\": 30.31363, \"longitude\": -95.17966, \"date\": \"2007-11-15T00:00:00\", \"number\": 28873.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9vkk6nkm9n\", \"temperature_high\": 65.58, \"temperature_mid\": 51.89, \"temperature_low\": 38.2, \"dew_point\": 28.62, \"humidity\": 0.33, \"cloud_cover\": 0.13, \"moon_phase\": 0.18, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1026.17, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 358.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.96, \"location\": \"POINT(-95.17966 30.31363)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Hi..i was driving down TT 62 coming from Salem Ohio about 7 pm dusk on October 20 2015 with my 16 year-old daughter.. we were almost to an intersection of freeway entrance and out of the corner of my eye coming from the left side I notice movement then saw a brown leg..at first i thought it was a deer, I have almost hit several in this area.

I was hunting with a single shot muzzle loader.I sprayed myself with human scent shield prior to entering the woods.I walked through a high grass field,crossed a barb-wire fence and entered the woods. I walked up a ridge and sat down on top of a large rock facing that was protruding out of the side of the hill. Where I was sitting was directly above the trail that the deer had been traveling.I could see shapes of trees and the outline of the woods against the fence. I began to hear something walking in the high grass of the field to my right.I then heard the barbed-wire cling together as if it something had crossed it.I then heard the leaves begin to crunch and crush underneath steps being taken.I could see something walking in a zig zag pattern below me.

I then began to hear the sound of a grunt and low toned growl.As the figure came closer I could make out the shape of a man walking up the hill in a zig zag pattern.

Four years ago in mid September 2007, we decided to camp on our property which is located in Doe Valley Community.  The community is very special...it is nestled against Fort Knox Reservation and large forested areas.  Doe Valley is a nature reserve where deer, turkey, foxes and numerous other indigenous animals are so tame they will come up to be hand fed.  There is a no hunting restriction on the area which is riddled with caves and creeks.  In fact, the creek which backs up to our property was named by Squire Boone and hunted by the Boone family.  Several abandoned mills here were even built by Abraham Lincoln's father...so the area is very steeped in natural and American history. As we began camping this evening, we noticed that several rocks were rolling on the ground at different points in our night.  I was concerned someone was in the woods throwing stones, but our community is very rural and this would have been something very rare. We had also been hearing what appeared to be a loud howling...a mix between a female screaming and a wolf howl.  Not a fox yelp as we are used to hearing those...but much deeper and louder. The hour grew late, and my children got sleepy...so they decided to retire into the tent.  My one son insisted on using his own dome camping tent and though I am unsure why I was so leary...being in such a safe location.  But, I told him that if he wanted to sleep in his own tent he would have to place it in direct view of our family tent's window so I could keep an eye on him. I went into my own tent after puting the fire out and lay down just to keep warm while I waited for dawn...the time was about 3 a.m. Then suddenly a sound came from outside of the tent in the woods...a sound of cracking and very heavy footsteps through grass. It went WHOOOSH thump WHOOOSH thump WHOOOOSH THUMP and I began to chuckle thinking...here the children waited up to see deer, or raccoons...and they come when we go to bed.  But then the thing walks up to my tent and begans to walk past.  But then I realize...wait...this is walking on only TWO FEET.  I begin to smell the odor of a wet dog mixed with a skunk...or like an elephant pen at the zoo.  Suddenly it BUMPS my tent over and over again as it makes its way past my tent in a direct approach to my son's tent and suddenly my son's ENTIRE f***ing tent came off the ground and is shaken in the air like it was nothing.  It was just shaking it up and down and Cody is screaming NO STOP>>>TURK!!! That is my older son who was 15 at the time.  He was sick and went in to bed because he has a condition which causes muscles to contract when he uses them.  Knowing this thing could not possibly be my son...as the tent is several feet off the ground and something VERY large I know is there because I heard it approach out of these acres of wooods I shout \\\"CODY IT'S NOT TURK!!!MY GOD!!\\\" and the thing immeditately throws the tent down and begins to run extremely fast back against my tent which again begins to BUMP BUMP BUMP!  against the side...and then I hear it going back into the woods with the same WHOOSH Thump sound and then the sounds of cracking branches. My son immediately ran to my tent, where we called my husband who was on his way home from his night shift job. Flash forward to this year, mid September 2011...and my son and daughter were outside of our home...and a stench began overcoming them in our two car garage which had both doors fully opened up.  My son came out to find out what was making this horrible odor.  There, in the middle of our yard, not ten feet from where the tent had been four years ago..was an enormous creature, dark fur and hug eyes lit by our porch. My other son comes to me and tells me that this is exactly the same discription of the creature he and his friend came across at our creek.  It was bent over at the edge of the creek and when they came closer...it jumped up on two feet and walked quickly into the woods. .... Now, about fifty years ago...my mother and her mother wound up in the newspaper in Madisonville Ky for a monster which nearly took the door to their rural home off one night.  She saw the monster howling and grunting at the window.  It left marks upon the tree outside their home and the sheriff made a report.  I refused to let my mother tell this story to my children...despite her swearing that it was not a bear.  I am the sort of person who likes to see things before I will believe it...and I thought it a foolish story. But, I am here to tell you...something is migrating through Doe Valley each year...and it is not something I have ever seen in the animal world before.  The natural gentle and plentiful climate here with caves and plenty of unexplored forests...I feel is its perfect home.

I was taking my time down NN traveling at around 30 mph to avoid any deer collisions due to the fact it is deer season.  I had seen frequent deer so I am very keen with knowing what animals in a field look like, especially through the peripheral vision of car headlights. I was about 5 miles from the Franklin County line when I saw a rabbit dart across the road and I slammed the brakes to avoid hitting it. I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me. I did not get a look at it's face other than the clear outline of the creature. I was very frightened at the site, and the sense of knowing it was an animal not native to Missouri, and it had just made me start to reconsider what I had just seen. I have recently heard of the Missouri MOMO, and I have been very skeptical about it. I would like to know what animal in Missouri could run at that speed on it's hind legs, surely a Bear cannot.

My family and myself dont ever talk about what happened. It happened one evening in the woods in mid November of 2003. My grandfather owns about 4,000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin, some barns, 3 lakes, and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father, grandfather, uncle, and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time, since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever! My father and I had just purchased a set of 2 way motorola radios to communicate between each other while hunting. well this particular spot i was going to hunt that evening was very deep in the woods in the north east corner of the property. My father and i had scouted this area the day before and we had noticed some strange things. Along the edge of the power line, for about a 20 foot stretch, there were tree limbs, about as round as my wrist, and a good 15-20 foot from the ground, broken and snapped off. There was this rock about thirty feet into the woods from the power line. This huge rock had been recently overturned but the thing was about 4 or 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall. This part of the woods had main power lines running through it which are very favorable to hunt deer on. I had decided that night that if a bear was in this area, I wanted to hunt it. I went there in the morning to set up my stand and scouted the area a little better. We met back at the cabin at 10:00a.m.. My grandfather said that he has never once seen a bear or bear signs of any kind in the 20 plus years hes been hunting in coweta county. He said it sounded ridiculous and that i shouldnt go hunt there by myself, but the thought of being able to bag a bear in these woods was too much! The time came to depart to the evening hunt. My dad told me to keep in touch with the 2 way radios if anything happened and that he would be located about half a mile or more from me. I rode my 4 wheeler down the familiar trails and parked it a couple hundred yards from my newly found hunting destination. As I approached my stand i had put there that morning i noticed a nasty smell in the air, not strong but would catch wiffs of it with the breeze. it smelled like old garbage. I was sitting in the tree stand for a good hour with no action, but the whole time that smell was barely present. My stand was about 40 feet into the woods from the power line near the overturned rock. the power line itself was streched along my left side with the thick woods to my front right and rear. I had a natural path through the woods to the power line, a perfect opening to see anything crossing. i was quietly looking around waiting for a bear to appear when all of a sudden i heard the familiar sound of a deer approaching fast from behind. i looked over my left shoulder to see a doe running through the woods at full pace from the powerline, running fast like something had spooked it. Out of the corner of my eye i saw a flash of movement through the woods along the edge of the power line, just where the doe was running from . i lifted my gun and peered through the scope to try and catch a glimpse of the figure that was making its way along the edge of the powerline. I was hoping it would be my bear and was waiting for it to cross that opening through the woods to the powerline for a clean, clear shot but when the creature/figure stepped into that opening, I saw through the scope that it wasnt a bear but looked human. Just 1 simple stride from this giant thing and it was out of sight of the opening. i was so stunned that i couldnt fire off a shot; besides i thought it was a man. But the thing was very tall, possiblly 8 feet. It had a cinnamon- dark brown hairy looking body. The shoulders were broad and squared and its long arms swung from side to side as it walked at a very fast pace. It happened so fast, i could only get a good look at it for a split second, letting me see enough to know that it wasnt a hunter. After it ran across the opening to the power line i heard a big commotion, starting at the powerline about where that thing should have been and heading into the woods right towards me! I tried to grab the motorola radio to get help from my father but was shaking so bad that i fumbled with it. I quickly lifted my rifle to get ready to blast whatever this big mysterious creature was. 3 more doe came bounding up looking spooked as hell which was the commotion i heard coming my way from the powerline.  The 3 doe ran as fast as they could and outta sight behind my right shoulder. Nothing followed them, nor did i see or hear it again, but that nasty smell still lingered in the air. I called my father on the radio and told him to get over to my spot to get me . I told him I wasnt getting out of the tree stand until he gets there. He came quickly to retrieve me and found me very disturbed. I told him everything that had happened and he didnt know if he believed me or not, but knew i had seen something.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Coweta County\", \"state\": \"Georgia\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 15457: Daylight sighting by hunter along powerline route near Newnan\", \"latitude\": 33.48295, \"longitude\": -84.7681, \"date\": \"2006-08-29T00:00:00\", \"number\": 15457.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"djgwrp3u24\", \"temperature_high\": 90.09, \"temperature_mid\": 81.31, \"temperature_low\": 72.53, \"dew_point\": 72.75, \"humidity\": 0.77, \"cloud_cover\": 0.23, \"moon_phase\": 0.18, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0001, \"precip_probability\": 0.17, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1011.82, \"summary\": \"Humid throughout the day and partly cloudy in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 7.0, \"visibility\": 8.75, \"wind_bearing\": 242.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.9, \"location\": \"POINT(-84.7681 33.48295)\"}, {\"observed\": \"On September 28th, 2007, my good friend and I were driving home from a show. We were driving out of Shady Springs through my grandpa\\u2019s farm, and like always, were watching for deer.  This was a beautiful evening. The skies were clear with only a slight chill in the air \\u2013 for it was right before dark around 6 or 6:30 in the P.M. This time we didn\\u2019t see a single deer but a HUGE \\u201csomething,\\u201d standing above a hay field about 200 yards away.  It really began to catch our attention due to the fact that it was a good 4 feet taller than the fence and standing on two legs.  So, in order to get a better look at him, we stepped out of the truck.  As it started walking (definitely walking upright on two legs) we noticed that it seemed to be a brown color with fur like a grizzly bear or something to that nature.  We then turned and looked at each other and said, \\u201cIs that Bigfoot?!\\u201d  No way, we thought. My friend and I have always thought that Bigfoot was a joke and a myth so we just stood there and watched him vanish over the next ridge, not even thinking to follow him.  We then went on home telling everyone what we had seen \\u2013 and yes, they all thought we were nuts!  However, my mom and my older brother had drove through their about 15 minutes earlier and she told me that when my brother had stopped to look for deer she had noticed something sitting above that hay field.  Thinking that it was just a bush or something, they drove on.  Now, I believe that whatever I had seen had been waiting on a deer to show up \\u2013 for the deer are plentiful out here.  I know that what I seen wasn\\u2019t a bear or a person.   I am telling the truth and this is legitimate. Then on January 21st, 2008,  on a cloudy evening right before dark (around 6 \\u2013 6:30 P.M) my friend\\u2019s older brother, who thought we were crazy, seen something big, black, fuzzy, and walking on its hind legs about 200 yards away just directly across the road where I had seen it in September.  This road goes through the valley of two mountain sides and it has been seen on both sides.  He said he seen it for a few minutes and then it disappeared over the backside of the mountain. He then called me and told what he had seen.  He said, \\u201cI just saw Bigfoot!\\u201d  There had been a snow storm that had just passed through a couple of days before. There was snow on the ground and the temperature was in the teens.  My neighbor and I got a light and the four-wheeler and headed that way to look for tracks or any kind of sign.  When we got the top of the mountain, the wind was blowing very hard. This caused the snow to be blown around like grains of sand.  We were, however, able to find tracks that we had never seen before.  Even though the tracks weren\\u2019t perfect due to the wind, they were still very unusual \\u2013 I am an avid woodsman and I have never seen tracks like that.  These tracks were narrow and about the size of a Men\\u2019s 8 \\u00bd shoe size.  The stance of the tracks was very wide \\u2013 far wider than a human. Then a few days later one of our good friends was visiting from a nearing town and he heard something he has never heard before. That night at our farm somewhere between the hours of 10 and 12, he described the noise as a short, but deep roar.  He said that even though it was far away, it was still very load.  He has never heard this before and he knows his wildlife. This next sighting has me WOWED! Since my friends and I have seen these sightings, my mom has been paying close attention to both sides of the mountain to look for that something we had been talking about.  On March 18, 2008, a partly cloudy day round 65 degrees, my mom was traveling to the local grocery store around 2 P.M.  As she was looking at the mountain side she noticed something huge and black standing on the mountain side about 200 yards away.  \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t believe what I was seeing!\\u201d she told me. This time it was on other end of the mountain where the brush is much thicker.  She then drove her Jeep Cherokee as far as she could until a gate stopped her.  She said that as she was driving her Jeep that way, the huge black creature was covering a lot of ground ON TWO LEGS \\u2013 not running, but covering a lot of territory.

The developer provided a \\u201cswamp buggy\\u201d for the tour.  It was an  old, modified (top removed) school bus with large tires.

Although the ranch was laced with timber and crop roads, many were flooded from a very wet winter / spring and therefore the swamp buggy was forced to take routes not often traveled.  Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranch\\u2019s bunk houses and barns,  the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).

This is the same place we had rock smashing and wood knocking the year before as I explained in Report # 13487.  This year we walked down towards falls creek to check out the area we heard rocks being smashed together the year before out of curiosity.  The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.

I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight. It was beating something in the head which I found to be a deer come sun up. The creature drug the deer up to the top of the hill above the camp sight. It walked up on top of some big rocks and I could make it out perfectly. 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair. The one friend who stayed the evening saw the exact same thing. I watched it eat the deer. It pulled off appendages like it was nothing. Shortly after it started eating it noticed our tent. It walked right down to the side of the tent, and the smell coming off of it was intensely musky. It knocked the frying pan out of the tree by the tent as it was walking by, and when it hit the ground, it ran back to the top of the hill. The deer carcass was gone, but hair and intestines were left behind. The liver, spleen, heart and lungs must have been eaten. We followed the drag marks from the carcass and found a mass of pine trees bent and broken into some form of shelter. I have many other encounters that I can share. They are real and they are here. I have had rocks thrown at me, and I have been charged by one twice. I barely got inside the house both times. They do not like light, and they do not like it if you shine a light directly at them. I say them because on more than one occasion my fianc\\u00e9 and I heard at least three. Hardwoods and swamps surround my house. When this started there were many subdivisions going in, and massive habitat loss which had to drive them to my property. There is also a 20,000 acre national forest that is squatchy as all get out about 7 miles from my home. The sounds are not as frequent now, but they can still be heard from time to time here. I only hear them in fall and winter though. I am also a hunter, and when I was hearing the Squatches every night, there was not a deer to be found. When I did see deer they were very jumpy. This was during archery season that I made this observation, therefore no gun shots were occurring to spook them. I promise you from the bottom of my heart that they are real.

This is an account of events that transpired during mine and my friends 5 day hunting trip on a 40 acre tract in Nashport, Ohio, in Muskingum County. This land adjoins Dillon State Park, which is 2,285 acres of state ground. Both my friend and I are experienced woodsmen and hunters, in having been in nature our whole lives. We are confident in our knowledge of animals, their behavior, and calls. This compiling of events at times left us confused, awestruck and at a loss for words. We both went into the woods with the understanding that there are some things that cannot be explained or fully understood yet. However, we left our trip with a much greater understanding than we thought imaginable when planning this trip. 12/1/15 Tuesday Just after dusk. Light rain and no wind. We heard a large tree knocked over in the woods. There was no wind or outside influence that should have caused the tree to crash down. About 30-45 minutes later, we heard a second tree fall, which sounded larger. Around 8pm we began to hear tree knocks coming from 3 different locations simultaneously. The first 2 sounded like someone hitting 2x4\\u2019s together. The 3rd on the other hand was much louder. It sounded like someone hit the tree with a very large Louisville Slugger. Around 10pm, we heard what sounded like someone walking through the woods whistling. It was a human-like whistle, but we were the only people around. At about 3am, my friend stepped out of the camper to use the bathroom. Upon walking outside, he heard another loud tree knock from the 3rd location as before. 12/2/15 Wednesday We hunted all day and returned to camp. After dark, the tree knocks began. This time it was only 2 locations. Around 10 to 10:30pm we began to hear whooping sounds coming off of a ridge about a \\u00bc of a mile away. Still inside the camper, the sounds were so loud we could feel them. The whoops lasted 15-20 seconds without pause. Within 5 minutes we heard the call again, but this time the duration of the call was shorter. We stepped outside of the camper to get a better sound quality and then heard a 3rd set of whoops, this time so loud the calls could be felt in your chest. When these calls were finally finished the woods and entire area around us went quiet. Not a sound. Just as the night before we continued to hear wood knocks. Also noted we could hear something banging/ beating on cars in the junkyard below our camp site. At times it was so loud whatever this was seemed to be upset and trying to rip off a car door. The junkyard is inaccessible at night.  Just as the night before my friend awoke around 3am to use the bathroom and upon stepping out of the camper was confronted with a very loud knock from the same area as the night before. 12/3/15 Thursday The evening was quiet until about 9-9:30pm. Out of the blue, we heard a very long, very deep, aggressive almost tarzan like yell coming from the same ridge as the whoops the night before. This brought a chill down our spines it was so loud. It was long and powerful and lasted a solid 20 seconds. Trees knocks continued from the same areas as previous nights almost like we were being observed all evening. They were lesser in frequency on this evening however. About an hour later we began to hear coyotes yipping near the same ridge as all the calls have been coming from. There was an answer to the coyotes, which was similar but definitely not a coyote. The tone and pitch were different and it was much louder. It was very bone chilling to say the least. Shortly after this we could hear growling sounding like it was coming from just outside the camper. We loaded our guns and prepared for an encounter with whatever was out there. We stepped out with a bright flashlight but we could not spot anything. The tree knocks continued until we went to bed. 12/4/15 Friday Sitting around the fire around 9pm, we heard another tarzan yell, this time it was on a further ridge. Guessing around a \\u00bd to \\u00be of a mile away. It was long and as loud of a call as the evening before, just further off in the distance. It was quiet again until about 9:45. From the lake and waterway about a \\u00bc to \\u00bd mile away, we heard a blood curdling high pitched scream. Also by the water way is a long set of rail road tracks that I wanted to note of here. From this point on we heard screams every 5 seconds. The screams progressively came closer and closer, moving down the creek bottom between the two large ridges. In no more than 30-60 seconds, the screaming had moved from the waterway again about a \\u00bc to \\u00bd a mile away to what sounded like 100 to 150 yards away at the tree line. About 10 to 15 seconds later we heard what sounded like someone or something jumping on the hood of a car and over the 8ft tall (give or take) junkyard fence, clipping it as it went over. This was astonishing because in this 10 to 15 seconds of time this thing moved through 400 yards of heavy cover. I do not know of any person or animal that could do this that would also be responsible for these noises. A few minutes after all of this commotion, we heard the same blood curdling screams coming off the ridge behind us as all of the screams as the nights before. 12/5/15 Saturday We set up a two man deer drive for the morning down the same ridges and holler from where the screams the night before were moving through. Moving as quickly as possible, it still took me an hour to cover and navigate the same ground as the high pitched screaming the night before. We decided to check out the area around the waterway for tracks to try and confirm what we thought we had been hearing throughout the week. At one end of the spillway, the water had receded to depths of only about 4 inches. There were nearly 20 tracks coming from the main ravine and rail road tracks and into the shallow end of the spillway. They all enter at the same place but veer off in 3 different directions. The tracks appeared to be 14-16 inches in length, 3-4 inches at the heel and 6 to 8 inches at the toe. This creature appeared to have a stride of nearly or about 5ft toe to toe. My friend documented these as pictures on his cell phone. Upon further investigation we found more tracks 20-30 yards away in the sand on the bank. We took pictures of these as well. One set was slightly smaller but when up next to my 11 \\u00bd size hunting boot it dwarfed my feet in comparison. We found another, larger track near these. This footprint was 16-18 inches long at least 4 inches at the heel and 8 inches or more at the toes. It was an older track but still stood out to us. We have a clear picture of this track up against my friends size 13 hunting boot and this track just swallowed it. These impressions sunk deeper than anything my friend or myself could recreate, and we are not small men at 210 and 185 lbs respectively. Investigating the bank line we could see multiple shellfish that had been eaten (potential secondary food source to all of the gut piles and wounded deer from gun season) There were no other animal tracks in the area that would have been known to be feeding on these aka raccoons. Also noted we noticed multiple footprints that looked to be from a child barefoot. These looked fresh. Why someone would let their child run around barefoot in December in cold water and mud is beyond me? Still not sure what to make of this. 12/6/15 Monday Upon returning home I spoke to my girlfriend about what had gone on during our hunting trip and finding the tracks and she was mind blown and interested. Since the tracks were on public land and deer gun season was over I know it would be safe to take her down to the water and show her the tracks and let her see the area. First I took her down to a sand bar to show her an angle I had at a nice deer on Wednesday. When we got down there she said wow bigfoot. When we looked down there was a fresh set of tracks in the 14-16 inch range very similar to the other ones noted already. They were so fresh you could see where the mud had squished up between its toes.  She took pictures on her phone with her feet next to them as reference. I then took her over to the sandy bank and showed her the tracks my friend and I had found to get a second set of pictures. Upon getting over there we found another type of track. It was roughly 14 inches in length but appeared to have severe hammer toe and or arthritis. It was roughly 4 inches at the heel and roughly 8 inches at the toes. We took pictures of this track as well. When exploring near the wood line I noticed how a very large creature had been moving through there. I found a large impression in the leaves. I began to remove them to get a better look at what was below. We found what appears to be very very large footprints. These were between 20 and 24 inches in length, well over 5 inches at the heel, and 10 to 12 inches at the toe. A picture was also taken of this impression. Upon seeing these the feeling of being watched began to overwhelm my girlfriend and we quietly left the area. At the end of this trip we left with some astounding experiences and a sense of shock. However, we both feel this is not a series of coincidences or random actions. Given our encounters and physical evidence which we were able to document, we strongly feel there is one explanation Bigfoot. Being experienced trackers, we feel these creatures are using the railroad tracks as a highway to come and go with minimal trace. Our interactions this week led two outdoorsmen who are very comfortable in uninhabited woods to sleep with loaded guns within arm\\u2019s reach. Each of us there will think twice before staying or wondering near or in nearly untouched woods at night alone. Although we did not get a visual, we fully believe this creature is large, athletic and completely in its element in the woods at dark.\", \"location_details\": \"Just south of State Rte 16 off of 146, North of Dillon State Park\", \"county\": \"Muskingum County\", \"state\": \"Ohio\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 50393: Two deer hunters experience a likely week-long encounter near Nashport\", \"latitude\": 40.01209, \"longitude\": -82.13298, \"date\": \"2015-12-01T00:00:00\", \"number\": 50393.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dpjee5bx6f\", \"temperature_high\": 58.61, \"temperature_mid\": 49.165, \"temperature_low\": 39.72, \"dew_point\": 49.46, \"humidity\": 0.96, \"cloud_cover\": 0.84, \"moon_phase\": 0.7, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0063, \"precip_probability\": 0.86, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1012.79, \"summary\": \"Light rain in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 2.13, \"wind_bearing\": 199.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.76, \"location\": \"POINT(-82.13298 40.01209)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Me and my family had moved to the Mongomery county area in October of 2001.In december I had noticed a old logging road leading into the Sam Houston National Forest from the sub-division which was still under development at the time.I haven't hiked since I was a teenager so I decided to see where this road went when weather permitted.In April 2002 I had taken some vacation time from work and one afternoon after mowing I thought I would go for a walk a routine I continued for several days going further down the road and deeper into the woods with each trek.I had seen evidence of deer, hog, squirrel and even bear in the area. On the sixth day I walked by an area that had springs on both sides of the trail which alternated sides every so often. I noticed on this trip there was no animal sounds or activety and I felt watched. So I stopped and surveyed my surroundings and to the east of me about 25yds in the thick underbrush something quite robust in size and dark in color seemed to be crouched between a couple of trees looking in my direction. I thought it was a large hog or maybe a bear so I turned south heading toward home and this creature moved along with me keeping a distance of approximately 15-30yds between us at all times. We continued this kind of cat and mouse routine for about 20-25 minutes. I stopped to releave myself. Then suddenly I don't know what possessed me to turn into the woods toward this creature. It stopped and crouched very low to the ground and remained perfectly still. I had gotten into about 10 yds. and I got wind of a strange odor I can't describe I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the creature's area. I could see it was very dark in color and almost lying in a prone position much like a sniper lining up a shot it and human like legs only very hairy I could make out thick arms and shoulders also covered with thick hair probibly no more 1-2\\\" in length. It was down almost as if it was tring to hide it's face. I would estimate it to be no more than 6ft.tall.The hair on my neck stood up when I heard movement of something large moving in woods from accross the trail behind me. I moved quckly back onto the trail and it seemed I wasn't being followed so I slowed my pace, by this time I was about 100-125 yards from the point I had urinated I turned and saw this dark figure walk upright out of the east woods and stop at my puddle area it squatted for a few second then stood up and looked directly at me for a few more seconds. It head turned abruptly toward the west woods and much larger dark being came slightly into view they both watched me as I back peddled watching them for another dozen or so yards when I decide home was the best place to be and ran off.\", \"location_details\": \"Hwy105@Crockett Martin\", \"county\": \"Montgomery County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 10733: Hiker has daytime encounter in Sam Houston National Forest\", \"latitude\": 30.31667, \"longitude\": -95.32, \"date\": \"2002-04-17T00:00:00\", \"number\": 10733.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9vkhqyyp7h\", \"temperature_high\": 84.47, \"temperature_mid\": 77.27, \"temperature_low\": 70.07, \"dew_point\": 70.4, \"humidity\": 0.8, \"cloud_cover\": 0.73, \"moon_phase\": 0.16, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1018.19, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy until evening.\", \"uv_index\": 6.0, \"visibility\": 9.37, \"wind_bearing\": 144.0, \"wind_speed\": 9.03, \"location\": \"POINT(-95.32 30.316670000000002)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Sounds in the woods and the sights of tree limbs or structures shown are everywhere in the sowega (southwest Georgia) area of Georgia.

It had to have been in 1977. I was 16 and the others were 15-16 years old.  This was my fishing and camping site on the pipeline and I had built a lean too and we were all out there that Friday evening drinking some beer and going to fish for trout in the morning.  We had a camp site with a fire pit and we had a good bon fire going.  We were sitting around the campfire it must have been around 9-10 P.M. We were not drunk out of our minds.  In the distance we heard this walking coming from the east in the woods following the creek.  I had been chased by a bear out there on occasion so I felt it was a bear coming down the creek.  Then it sounded like a person walking through the woods so we thought it may be the Game Warden, who knew all of us kids and he may be checking for trout lines.  Then came the odor, Worst case of B.O. I have ever smelled to be honest. I again thought this is a bear because of the smell and I started to get a little nervous because we had food out there but it was hung up in a tree. As it approached us, it came far enough into the light to show a shadow.  It was on 2 legs standing up, very tall, every bit of I would say 8 foot, and walking in very huge strides, swinging it arms, making alot of noise.

We were all so scared as to who or what it was we sat in silence around the fire as it passed, watching, and not sure of what we were watching. Again I can tell you the smell was obnoxious.  To be honest, I have smelled bears before and since, and they really do not have that kind of obnoxious odor. As I said before, I am the only one that really talks about it, seeing your web site I see back in that time period there were several sightings in St. Louis County which is a county bordering Carlton County.  I had no idea there had been sightings in this area before.  I can not say for sure what it was because all I seen was a shadow. But a srange type of shadowed figure to see in the woods. A bear could not walk that long on 2 legs, plus a bear does not take the strides that this creature did.  The only thing I can come up with is that we had an experience with a Big Foot.  We never did go and look for foot prints the next morning.  I think we were all glad it did not come into our camp because we had no clue as to what it was.  I have no reason to tell a story about this and I am not known by people as a story teller.

That is where we saw the individuals. At first we thought they were the capture team looking for us. They were back in the tree line when we first saw them. There was a road not far behind them and we could see what we thought were soldiers moving very slowly (not forward or back at first). When they breached the tree line, Mickles decided that we had enough space between us and them to escape if they were part of the capture team. He thought it might be some like ourselves who escaped early and got out of the boundary area. Mickles got up and started walking towards them and I followed. They were just silhouettes, but as we got closer Mickles waved at them, then they started moving towards us faster; not really running, just faster. Mickles called to them and they came faster without answering. I have never heard of bears walking upright, and for sure not that fast but I didn't know that much about bears. I did know that something wasn't right and I was really scared. I really didn't think they were bears or people;  I don't know why.  I just know I have never been that terrified and so was Mickles. We ran as fast as we could without looking back, but felt they were gaining on us. I told Mickles to follow me and dove under and crawled up under a large low pine tree. We just lay there. We could feel their presence but didn't dare move. That is when we smelled this weird odor. I am sorry I can't describe it to you. It was strong is all I can say. We stayed there for probably fifteen minutes and then I said let's head for the road and we did. By that time the maneuver was over and we saw a bus pull up by the compound. We ran as fast as we could and caught the bus. We never looked back, except in memory. I have hunted all over the U.S. from Colorado, to Illinois, to Texas.

I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip. We arrived at the campground late.  There was only 1 other camper there with a RV.  We started into the woods around 5pm.  The terrain is extremely rugged and steep.  As we were hiking we noticed that it was very quiet.  Not a single bird call, or anything.  It was an eerie feeling.  We set up camp about 3 miles on the path that led up to the observation tower (High Knob).  We had dinner and got into the tent around 9-10 pm.  Around 11-12 pm my brother and I heard a very odd howl, it lasted for around 10 seconds.  It was not a dog or bear or anything I had heard before.  I thought it was strange but assured my brother it was nothing.  Around 2 pm my friend woke me up and pointed at his ear, signaling me to listen.  I paused and listened.  To me I heard what sounded like someone  slowly walking up to our tent, choosing their steps very carefully.  I whispered to him its a deer to calm his nerves.  But all three of us listened as the steps got closer.  The steps were heavy but slow.  My brother said to me \\\"Get the shotgun.\\\"  But not in a whisper.  The steps stopped and sounded like they went the other direction.  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark.  The next morning we continued up the hill.  At the top of hill .5 mile from where we camped there was a large pile of feces with acorns in it.  Possibly bear, not sure.  My brother was in poor psychical condition and could not continue so we decided to leave. When I got home I decided to see if i could find an animal call matching the sound we had heard.  I looked up a lot of different animals, from cougars to foxes.  Nothing matched.  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings.  The first one I clicked was it.  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?

My son took me to the tree and showed me where someone or something was looking at him from between a fork in the tree. That was two years ago.  Yesterday my oldest son aged 15 was standing in the living room and glanced out the picture window. He said something huge and black ran from some trees we have there to beside the garage.  I was kidding and said, \\\"Is it bigfoot?\\\" And he said very seriously, \\\"yeah, I think it was.\\\"  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing.  I ran behind the garage and to the other side but nothing was there.  I live near a heavily wooded area and the woods are close to the house behind and to one side of it.  The garage blocks the veiw of the yard and you can only see the front/side from the window. Whatever it was would have had plenty of time to run into the woods.

He thought my husband or son was playing a trick on him and trying to scare him.  He told him to come out and when my husband went out to him Bobby told him something big was running from tree to tree looking at him.  He said it was black and even though it was dark he saw the outline of the face.  Which is why he thought it was my husband or son. This would have been about 40ft ending to 20 ft away from him. He said it came from right outside the tree line from the yard and then went into the treeline running from tree to tree looking at him and getting closer to him. Like it was trying to hide from him but still keep an eye on him. When my husband came out Bobby turned away to ask him if my son was playing a joke.  When he turned back it was gone.  They came in and told me so we went out with the camera and took some pictures of the woods in the dark.  I don't know if I got anything or not. Whatever it is, from descriptions given to me, its about 6'-6'4 and since everyone says its about the size of my husband or son...husband is 6' 215 and son is 6' 240..

There was a campsite farther down from us with a husband and a wife. They also were sitting by the fire. My friends and i decided to take a walk about the campsite. There is a open field along the road of the campsite Josh and I decided to sit there to see if we could call in some coyotes that night because the moon was full that night making it easy to see. The rest of the guys went back to the campsite. Josh and I went and sat along the side of the field. We were sitting there, making the sound of a dying rabbit. The field is border with large trees, and bushes. After about 10-15 minutes, we see a large \\\"person\\\" step out onto a little hill at the edge of the trees off to our left. We had a tall friend with us so started saying to the person, \\\" haha Mike very funny!\\\" gestures of that sort and the person didnt move or speak. All we could see was its upper torso and its eyes color, I can't recall the exact color. So we ran back to the campsite to make sure it wasnt just our friends spooking us, and sure enough they were all there. Josh and I grabed a shotgun that I had brung for safety, and when we got back to the spot the \\\"person\\\" was gone. We were both very frightened by this we ran back to the campsite told everyone what we heard no one believed us. Later that night I saw it again, this time it was in the woods across from our campsite, just on the edge of the woods. The moonlight was bright. This time I called everyone over to look, this time Mike, Josh and me all saw a very large black shadow across the road moving towards the first spot we had seen it. After the incident I really had no idea what this was. It was very large man like probably about 6- 6.5 ft tall all i could tell is it had a black color to it.

It turned from the light and walked slowly down the driveway. I yelled to my dad who was downstairs, do you want to know what the dogs have been barking at? I ran downstairs finishing my sentence, telling him that it was walking in our yard.  My father ran outside with a gun to shoot it, and could not locate it in the dark.  I don't think the moon was out that night.  My dad did have a flashlight though and our front yard is full of trees.

Then, after 15 or 20 min. of the huffing in front of us, it got quiet.  Then my Sister heard a noise behind her in the woods, that sounded like an angry growl. I told her it was only the dogs growling at something. She informed me both my dogs were right there with her, and it wasn't them. So, she pulled out a pistol and turned and faced the direction it came from, and I went to get my rifle, and slung it across my back. Then, it got quiet and we didn't hear anymore of that during the night. Whatever it was knew what a gun was. My dogs never barked or went to investigate anything. They stayed right with us. They are watch dogs at my home, and have been camping numerous times. They seemed to want our protection this time.

The next night we broke camp about an hour before dark, and once more everything became deathly quiet again, and the feeling like we were being watched. We finished loading about dark, and as we started to leave, it came a downpour, so I was coming down off the mountain about 5 to 10 mph. At one point my Sister commented about one \\\"bushy pine tree\\\" in a grove of aspen trees, when the headlights flashed. About halfway down a vehicle caught up with us, and informed me the doors were open on my trailer. We stopped to close them, and my lock was broken. When we got into town, we stopped at a gas station, and there I noticed handprints and muddy smears on the camper. They we too big and too high for any of us to reach.

It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, \\\"what was that?\\\"  I started to answer her with an \\\"I am not sure\\\" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, \\\"is that Bigfoot\\\".   I said \\\"I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot\\\".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn't have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.

I was witness to several incidents when I lived just outside Commerce. At the time I was employed for the Delta County Sheriffs Dept as a deputy. It was around 1990 and a friend and I were in the business of buying dairy calves to raise and resell. My friend lived in an area close to the town of Horton. The actual town is now under water - part of Cooper Lake. This was a very remote area of dense thick woods running all the way to Sulphur Springs. My friend began finding his calves dead at the barn. It appeared that their necks had been broken. This all came to a head on an evening as he heard his boar hog squealing loudly from the pen. The pen was located at the edge of the woods. My friend had a very mean boar hog that weighed around 400lbs. He called me on the phone and told me to come as fast as I could. When I arrived he was almost in shock and told me that he went and grabbed his rifle and went to the barn. He said that he saw a very tall hairy creature lifting this boar hog over the pallet fence. My friend fired a shot at it and it dropped the hog and ran off. My father and I went to the pen and found a set of tracks. These resembled a very large human foot in the dirt. My father - a retired Dallas police officer, contacted my friend's neighbor. The neighbor was also a retired police officer and professor at Northeast Texas Community College. He came and called a couple of his students and plaster casts were made of the print. Several pics were taken of the cast and one was even printed in the local paper. The cast went on display at the college in the science dept. I have the cast. At this time I am still trying to find where it was stored to get the dimensions for you. As we were talking with my friend's neighbor, he advised that he oversaw a cabin across from him (bordering my friend's land) way back in the woods. The owner had said that strange things were happening at this place. We saw that the tracks went due east toward this other piece of property. We went to the cabin and saw several more of the footprints going in a circle around the cabin. Over time we saw and measured two other sets of tracks. The only size I remember was 12 inches. The other tracks were bigger than the set we cast. The strange happenings always started in the spring and continued until the late fall. His property is about 2 miles from the Horton bottoms where I know several people who have seen this creature but would not go public for fear of being thought crazy. One was chased out of the bottoms while duck hunting at a slew (see ). I have since moved to a different part of the county. About eight years ago a friend and I were walking along the Sulphur River and found tracks going to the water as if to get something to drink. As I said I am still looking for the cast as my dad put it into storage. As soon as it is found I would be glad to send a pic to you. In the cast you can clearly see the tissue ridges on the bottom of the toes - much like ours. I am curious if anyone has ever reported anything like this in this area. I have nothing to gain from telling this story. I have been a law enforcement officer in this area for 13 years. At first I told a couple of people of what I had seen and most thought I was crazy.

To make a long story short, while hiking in a very dense gorge between two mountains, we came across a nest. If you have never been to the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, let me tell you - it is DENSE! I mean, there could be a hundred Bigfoots within twenty yards of you and you wouldn't see them. Ferns and other under growth are growing anywhere from waist to shoulder length, with absolutely towering trees every few feet - truely amazing. The nest was completely conceiled, and if I hadn't walked directly in front of the opening, I never would have even noticed it. The construction was unbelievable; the under growth was woven to form a about a seven foot tunnel leading to a larger doomed inner room, about the size of a mid-sized car. The tunnel leading to the room was perfectly round and had another bush pulled towards it to conceal the entrance. We went inside to look for evidence or smell, but could find neither. While investigating inside we both looked at each other, for no reason, and both of us suddenly became very spooked. We didn't see or hear anything, just knew we had to get the hell out of there and did. We were going to go back later, but the weather went to hell and was pouring down rain. We had been trying to find some caves that are down in the gorge but never found them. I am going back in the spring to this same place where we found the nest and camp for a couple of days.

I recently had a sighting and was looking in the reports provided here to see if there had been many in KY.  I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4\\\" 200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as \\\"Howdy\\\" because he waves. Ive had her retell the story to friends and family over the years and it stays consistant but never much detail. I was actually jealous.  I thought, if she really did see something, why couldn't I have seen it too so I could know for sure, plus as I stated before, I was always curious.  I kept an extra eye out for a while but never saw anything and pretty much dismissed it. Modern Rifle season, November 2011.  I was deer hunting by myself on the same property (mine) that borders the abandoned ***** ******** mentioned in a previous report.  It was getting close to dusk and I was considering getting out of the deer stand soon when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes.  From left to right I watched 2 creatures, both larger than me and covered in long hair, running upright on 2 feet.  There was no mistake these were big foot(s).  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde.  More like coyote colored blonde.  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them.  They ran within 25 yards right in front of me!  I honestly cant give much detail about the faces, they were looking behind them alot plus I was simply shocked and not looking for detail.  They covered ground quickly and were gone in less than 10 seconds.  They dissapeared into a clump of trees behind my pond.  I pulled my scope up but could only make out \\\"something' going through the woods once they passed.  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints.  I couldnt find anything but it was cold, dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined.

The boys caught on to this right away, and said, \\u201cMom, it\\u2019s getting closer\\u201d.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance, so I yelled, \\\"Is anybody out there?\\\" Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4). I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first, but realized I could neither see, nor identify the sound. The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping, so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something, but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time, but never said anything because I didn't want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same \\\"watched\\\" feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us, but I never saw anything. We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck, but not the boys. It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker), bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions, we had a young cougar, then a bear run in front of our pickup and we're very familiar with their \\\"walking and verbal\\\"  sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup. I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I'm very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real, but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel's research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County, along with a lot of other information and projects. I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever it\\u2019s worth.  I can\\u2019t explain it, and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard.

We were camping on the Meremac River. The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son, my daughter and a friend and his wife. The place we camped was on an elderly ladies farm. There were about 5 other campsites, all about 30 yards apart, with our campsite being on the end and closest to where the woods became thick. There was a dirt road that went from our spot into the woods a short distance. While myself and my friend were gathering fire wood, my son...about 7 at the time, sat at the begining of the road playing in the dirt. My wife said all of a sudden he looked down the road, jumped up and made a bee line for her, all the time yelling \\\" Mommy a big black man. My friend and I heard him screaming and ran back to camp to see what was wrong. I know my son was young at the time, but I'd never seen him so upset. He kept repeating that he saw a big black man standing part way down the road. Now at the time, we lived in St. Louis and my son was used to seeing black people but he insisted this man was differant. After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall. Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6'2'. He also insisted the man wasn't wearing clothes but was covered with black hair. My friend and I were both armed and decided to take a look down the road. It was getting dark by then and we didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close. There was to be a huge meteore shower that night so we walked out into a pasture to have a clear view of the sky. The pasture bordered the woods on our left, with our camp and the river to our front. We hadn't been sitting there long when we heard something heavy walking around in the woods. At first we thought it might be a stray cow but the more we listened it sounded more like the way a man would move. What really got our attention was that all of a sudden we heard limbs snapping. Not small ones but big enough to sound like rifle shots. I'm a Vietnam Vet and a long time hunter. I've never heard anything move through woods like that. It spooked us enough that even though we were armed, both carrying .44 cal hand guns, we didn't venture into the woods to investigate. That ended our star gazeing and we spent most of the rest of the night sitting in camp with our pistols close at hand. The next day we found where something had bulldozed it's way through the heavy bush and left some good sized broken limbs and saplings in its wake, but to be honest we didn't look too close. Also the smell of something dead was gone. The rest of the camping trip was un eventfull though I did notice one thing. The lady who's land we were camping on was carrying a 12 gage shotgun every time we saw her. She even had it across her lap when she'd sit on her porch. Never knew her to do that before. She was of old hillbilly stock and not one to scare easy so I asked her about it. She just replied she wanted it close and would say no more. To sum it up, My son's insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder.

It is about 1/2 mile from the bus stop to his house.  As he was cutting across the woods, about 100 feet from the bus stop and 20 feet off the pavement, he jumped up onto a stump.

In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift, like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately, he could not avoid contact, and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving, realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company, his job, and me. I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o'clock in the morning. I am driving, wide awake, looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid, but he said it was HUGE, and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies, snakes, gators, whatever.  I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it's not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a \\\"man\\\" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he's tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where's his truck? Where's his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He's not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don't think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn't want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn't. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a \\\"hey--maybe that's a \\\"somethin'  \\\" at a moment's notice.  Meanwhile, since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks.

I saw something (I'm not saying it was a bigfoot,) large bending over (its back facing me). It looked like it was picking something up off the highway that runs over the bridge. It was pretty different than I had imagined they looked like, though. It was really tall, even bending over the way it was. It had long, straight brown hair, though, like a dog or something. I always pictured them to have black hair, but this was brown. There were things hanging in the hair, little sticks and undergrowth looking stuff, and it was really dirty. The only other thing I really remember is the smell as I drove by, it was awful! I was driving my convertible with the top down, and the smell of what ever that was - well, I can't even describe how bad it was. That's really all I saw, etc. I was driving about 60 mph and after I saw whatever that was, I sort of got the creeps and sped home and ran in to tell my husband what happened. I didn't even put the top back up on the convertible. The bridge that I saw whatever that was on is only about a quarter of a mile from my house. So, needless to say, I'm not real happy about coming home from work after dark anymore. Also, I know this sounds weird, but about a week and 1/2 before the sighting, we kept hearing the strangest scream (that's the best way to describe the noise,) and it was not one of our calves or any of our livestock, and after about 2 days of hearing this noise, it finally stopped. The next day, we found a little baby goat with the umbilical cord still attached and dragging the ground all alone - no mother goat to be found anywhere. We found him all alone in the wooded area back behind our house. When we found him, he was terrified, he didn't make a noise or anything - it took us hours to catch him. He finally bleats (cries) now, and it sounds nothing like the noise we heard before we found him. We have also lost 4 baby kittens in the last month, they seem to have just disappeared. We do live way out in the country, though.

This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord. It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive. The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that fit those two things. First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on, I would never have seen this creature. At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons, but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film. It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it. When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with \\\"Does not compute\\\" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film. So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was. It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got \\\"Oh yeah, this happened and that happened,\\\" To \\\"My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a couple of personal stories from people who grew up here. I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of left me wondering, if I had to be honest. Now I know we share our woods with one big sumbitch, and you better be paying attention when you are cookin up that bacon at 8 pm in the woods around here cuz I don't think he got that big eatin dandelion greens. :) My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am still questioning myself the next day. Like I said your brain tries to rationalize anything that \\\"Does not Compute\\\" but I was not under the influence of anything. Still puzzling and marvelling over it all.

As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, \\\"What was that?\\\" She said, \\\"I don't know.\\\" At this point I am still thinking that it was a person, but that it was strange. There was a dirt logging road that crossed the highway right where the creature was standing. I started slowing down and expected to see a person, or a truck or camper on the road. As we went by and looked, there was nothing there. We continued down the road and my wife and I talked about what we had seen. My daughter was in the back seat of the truck and did not see anything. I all happened very quickly. I did not see anything until it moved as I was proocuppied by driving and towing. My wife saw it standing there by the road before it moved and clearly saw hair and could see both sides of the torso. I kept running over in my mind what it might have been. I have lived in this area all of my life and have seen every animal that lives in the woods. This did not fit in any catagory. The only thing that color is a black bear, and this clearly was not a bear. We finally agreed that it may have been a bigfoot. We decided to hurry to out camp and drop the trailer and get back down and look for tracks. I had my camera and my intention was to find some tracks and get some pictures of them. We went to camp and hurried back to the spot. The time since we went by was about an hour. The logging road turned out to be very dry and hard. I searched all around in the forest and on the other side of the highway for tracks, but could not find anything that was clearly a bigfoot track. I went back to were it was standing an stood in the same spot and was looking up in the tree standing there looking for a bees nest or something that perhaps a bear might be interested in. I was still trying to eliminate all other possibilities. Then it occured to me that when I had seen this creature step off of the road that it had stepped behind some branches on this tree.

From that direction I heard a \\\"knocking\\\" sound.  Not a woodpecker as this was slow and not too loud.  Then I heard a soft whistle and what sounded like a parrot or mynah bird when it's trying to learn to talk.  Just kind of \\\"gibberish\\\", then the knocking and the soft whistle.  Again, I've heard all kinds of sounds in the mountains, having been raised there, but nothing like this.  I walked across the roadway and looked down into the trees, but saw nothing.

He had invited me to come out and spend the weekend with him in hopes of planning a fishing adventure down to Piney Creek. On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx. 7:00am. With fishing gear,lunches and other necessities in hand, we made our way through the woods, past Kliningsmiths Pond, and over to the branch that would lead us to down to Piney Creek which was about a 3 mile hike. After spending the day fishing and doing things that teenage boys do we began to head back up the mountain. As we walked and talked, moving along the rail road that snakes its way through the gorge, it became apparent to us that we may not have been alone. Eerily we all had the feeling that someone, or something, was watching us, and following us from a distance. Paranoia began to set in, and we began to pick up the pace. By the time we reached the branch that we we're to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow. We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300' feet above us. I had an old Red Rider BB gun with me, like it would have done any good, and it was rattling in my hands has they trembled. Maybe someone was watching us. Just in a matter of minutes, large boulders, the size of a washer or drier, came down, one after the other, headed right for us. We froze like stone statues, scared to death. After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground. Thats when, against my better judgement, I turned to look back, just in time to see a large black shape disapear over the hillside. We ran all the way to Sams house, which was still a good mile and a half away. As the years went by, we looked back on that day and laughed at one another, joking about how scared each one of us were, and tried to come up with a reasonable explaination. I don't know if what I saw was a Big Foot, or a figment of my imagination.

I had been driving down the lease road going through a very large ranch on the Canadian River Valley in the Texas Panhandle. It was about 7:30 p.m.  I was driving very slow, approximately 10-15 MPH, because the ranch has speed limits on their lease roads and the roads are very rough. This location is on private property and out of respect for the landowner I will not disclose the location. It is a very desolate area, about 23 miles to the nearest town. There are very few homes in the area with about 5-10 miles between homes. It was unusual weather for mid-July. It was warm but overcast with clouds and a breeze coming out the north. It was still very bright for it was over an hour before sunset. I was driving along noticing how heavy the plum bushes were loaded. We haven\\u2019t had a good crop of Sand Plums in several years on account of the severe drought that we had been suffering from. I noticed out of my peripheral vision what looked to be a very tall and very thick butt of a bull. I kept thinking this was very unusual to see a river ranch bull that is so large and thick. I have only seen this type of bull on the show circuit, I have showed cattle in 4-H and FFA and my kids showed cattle also, I grew up on a dairy farm and we also raised beef cattle, I have raised cattle for over 40 years and been around many different breeds of cattle, yet this one was exceptionally large. As I got closer to this bull I starting getting a clearer look at it.  Bulls this thick typically don't have much of a tail head, they are pretty flat topped, but this one did. As I got closer I realized he didn't have a tail at all.  The hair was wrong and too long for a bull. It was brown with a reddish tint on the ends as if sun bleached. This bull has 4-6 inch long, bleached out strawberry blonde, matted hair hanging just above mid-point on him. I then notice that I couldn\\u2019t see under this bull, and that it\\u2019s very wide at the ground level. This made no sense. By this time, there was no brush between me and him to block my view of this thing! He was standing in the open on bare ground. There was a large shade tree; the cattle used a good bit because there was no grass around the tree. Then it HIT me, this is a Bigfoot. I cannot believe it. Not 70 feet from me. My pickup and trailer are a total of 65 feet long so it was pretty easy to figure the distance to him. I realize I caught the big fellow out in the wide open. I knew I was coming up on a curve in the road and I could drive off into a deep ditch so I looked up to stay on the road, hitting my brakes to stop. I didn't take my eyes off of him for more than 2 seconds, but that was all he needed. He was gone. There is a small canyon about 30 feet to the south of where he was.  I believe he went that direction.  I jumped out of my truck and ran down to the end of my trailer to try to see this massive creature again, then I realized, with its size and speed that was probably not a good idea. As I walked back to my truck, watching my back, I knew where he had been standing and that there was probably footprints and knuckle prints there that I could take pictures of, I had my camera with me, and I\\u2019d have proof to show my family of what I saw. But I also knew he could be on top of me in 2 seconds if I went over there. I had my phone and my camera with me but it never entered my mind to grab them while the creature was standing there in front of me. I have always heard of these being described as massive creatures. Truly that is the only way to describe it. The shoulders and arms were massive. I didn't get a good look at its face because I was too busy  wondering why I couldn't see under it, so I focused more on the lower half. But I did notice the contrasting colors of its face. It was lighter around the eyes and darker over the nose and I think I caught him with sand plums in his mouth because of the red tint in the lip area. He looked to be at least 5' 6\\\" tall down on his knuckles and could be easily taller than that. He was very wide, I am 6'3\\\" and 235 lbs and he was at least 1 1/2 to 2 of me in width. Down on my knuckles I am on 3 feet tall. I know their arms are longer than humans, but this still makes him a very tall boy! I have had to estimate the weight of cattle most of my life and was always been within 10 -25 lbs of guessing them correctly. And I would estimate him weighing in the neighborhood of 850 lbs. With that said he could easily weigh more because of the shear muscle mass that I could see.\", \"location_details\": \"Directions will be given to investigator.\", \"county\": \"Roberts County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 56826: Close daytime sighting on a ranch in the Canadian River Valley\", \"latitude\": 35.93985, \"longitude\": -100.6767, \"date\": \"2014-07-14T00:00:00\", \"number\": 56826.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9y2kmn9kyc\", \"temperature_high\": 90.59, \"temperature_mid\": 78.215, \"temperature_low\": 65.84, \"dew_point\": 66.6, \"humidity\": 0.71, \"cloud_cover\": 0.34, \"moon_phase\": 0.58, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0017, \"precip_probability\": 0.7, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 11.0, \"visibility\": 9.75, \"wind_bearing\": 94.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.48, \"location\": \"POINT(-100.6767 35.93985)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My husband and I lived in Walla Walla, WA during the '95-'96 school year, and often went exploring in the nearby Blue Mountains.  Nearly every little diner and gas station seemed to have \\\"bigfoot\\\" plaster casts on the wall that \\\"were found 1 mile from here.\\\"  I thought it was all a big joke intended to boost tourism.  I did NOT believe in Bigfoot. One Saturday we were looking for an out-of-the-way place to explore where we wouldn't run into anybody.  We were driving down a remote track, maybe it was an old logging road, and finally had to stop when it crossed a large stream that was too deep for our little Geo Metro.  Since we were miles from the last sign of civilization, and since we couldn't go any farther, we decided to do some exploring right there. I remember getting out of the car and immediately feeling an intensely eerie sensation of being watched.  It was the kind of \\\"being watched\\\" that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I've never experienced that feeling either before or since.  The really odd part was that I could pin-point exactly where I thought I was being watched from, even though I couldn't see anything.  Just on the other side of the stream was a small, steep, tree-covered hill.  The weird sensation of being watched was coming from a point about half-way up that hillside, probably 40 feet from the stream. I knew there wasn't anybody else out there because we were so far out in the wilderness, so I figured it was all in my head. We started poking around the streambank (the stream was probably 15-20 feet wide) looking for Indian artifacts, animal tracks, wildflowers, anything interesting. The ground was soft enough for our car tracks to leave a bit of an indentation in the ground, but too firm for us to leave any tracks.  It was very grassy and weedy along the stream banks where we were. After about 20 minutes of poking around, I came across a huge footprint indented about an inch deep in the grassy ground.  It looked like a flat-footed human print complete with 5 toes but it was approximately 16-18 inches long.  And it made an indentation in an area where, at 150 pounds, we couldn't make ANY tracks. I couldn't believe I was really seeing this footprint, so I called my husband over to verify it.  He confirmed that I wasn't seeing things. I briefly scouted around and found 2 more tracks but by this time I was really getting scared.  Those huge tracks coupled with that eerie feeling of being watched nearly unnerved me.  We practically raced each other back to the car, and by that time I was on the verge of panic.  I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I was also an instant believer in Sasquatch. A friend later asked me if I'd gotten pictures of the tracks.  I told her that I couldn't remember if we had a camera in the car but that even if we'd had, you couldn't have paid me to have gone back for a picture.\", \"location_details\": \"Upon further discussion with the witness' husband, it was determined that the incident occurred east of Pendleton, OR in Union County.

This is late morning under a clear sky in August I should add.  We were near one of the banks when I \\\"felt\\\" something. I look across the water to a hill (approx 200 yds away) covered with course brown grass with a tree stump at the top. Seeing nothing else I went on with whatever we were doing but it occured to me that the \\\"tree stump\\\" was very much out of place on that hill. I look again and \\\"it\\\" has moved downhill closer to us. Realizing it was much taller and moving I pointed it out to the others, turned to see if they looked, when suddenly everyone bolted.

What description I can give is this: \\\"it\\\" was tall, 7 ft maybe. It appeared to covered in long brownish/grey fur and it did indeed stand upright. I call it a bigfoot because I am certain of what it WASN'T. Definitely not a bear and the liklihood of it being a human in a costume is extremely remote. My arguement there is one, Fla in August can be brutal even to the locals, damn near suicide to put on a heavy costume out in the sun. Two, the location. With the exception of the hill all else around was marshland, not very easy to get to. I know because I tried to at another time. Also as I stated it was very remote so the liklihood of a hoax at that time and place just doesn't add up. I cannot give more details of the bigfoot but I can say for myself that I didn't perceive any danger from it. More of a curiosity. As I stated I ran because the older brothers' did, it was their fear that had me running and to my regret that they did.

Sunday, September 12, 2004 at about 03:00 AM I was woken up from a sound sleep by a very loud noise.  I listened for a while and tried to figure out what could make such a loud, repetitive noise.  It wasn't a coyote howl or fishercat screach, didn't sound like any owl I know of, wasn't a raccoon or tree rodent...  After 15 - 20 minutes, I went to sleep. My dog woke me with frightened barking at 4:00 AM when the sound was twice as loud and I knew the critter was within 100 feet of the house.  Also, there were two responding calls, one sounded fairly close and one was in the distance.  I got up to make sure the sheep were OK in their pasture with an electric fence around it and there was nothing by the barn where the goats were.  I flashed the light over to the chicken coop and nothing was there either.  I flashed the light throughout the yard and into the trees to see if there was any clue or any danger to the animals.  I saw nothing and while I shone the light, the calls ceased. All day I asked EVERYONE if they knew of any local animal that made the noise and repeated it all day long.  A friend suggested that I look it up on the internet.  I listened to all sorts of animal vocalizations with no luck.  When I finally typed in the words of the actual sound it was an identical match to this site!!!  I'm not saying I had a bigfoot encounter, but I definately encountered whatever the campers up in Lincoln, NH encountered last summer!!!  There may be a rational explaination and someone may know of an indigenous animal that makes that sound -- and trust that I will still try to find out what it is... but the sound will resonate in my memory -- as it was like no other animal/bird I've ever heard.

The witness did not write up the story himself.] On November 9th, 2006,  the local media in southeastern Wisconsin ran a story about a possible sighting near Holy Hill. The story refered to the contracted worker whose job it is to pick up deer carcasses on the highway on a regular basis.  Some  versions of the news story said a deer carcass was stolen from his truck by an alleged bigfoot. The story ran in many newspapers across the country and quickly got the attention of various bigfoot researchers. Local TV also started reporting on the story. Local TV also reported on the story and used it as a good humor story for their broadcasts. Due to the topic awareness created by the local news story, other people in the area began talking about observations and experiences they had with a similar looking figure. I first sought out the contracted worker. He was frustrated because the media seemed to put words in his mouth about the incident. He didn't know what the animal was, and he did not say that it was a bigfoot. He merely described what happened, and what he observed. He emphatically stated he did not call it a bigfoot. The state trooper's report conveys what happened, and what Steve observed. It does not call it a bigfoot either, but some elements of the story seemed consistent with sasquatch behavior, especially the  Because of the deer element, the BFRO wanted to get a detailed, first-hand account of what Steve K. observed and experienced. I met with him a week later (11/17). We spoke for 45 minutes. He came across as a patient, rational person. I started off by measuring the distance from the front seat of the extended cab Dodge pickup to the end of the pickup with the tail-gate down, it was 13.5 feet. He showed me the lights he had on at the time: head lights, interior dome light, factory bed light, and he had an 18\\u2019\\u2019 amber beckon light flashing on top of the cab. The beckon light is positioned on the cab like a police car\\u2019s official lights where, there\\u2019s one flashing light on each end. I got into the diver\\u2019s seat of the pickup, looked in the center mirror like Steve K.  had done, AND had him stand were he saw the creature. He stood in the middle of the pickup just behind the open tail gate. I could see all of his head, and on the bottom, halfway between his shoulders and his elbows. Steve K. stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 230 lb. The lighting was sparse, but I could see his facial features. If it was an all black form like what Steve says, I can\\u2019t imagine being able to see a lot of detail. Next we spoke about the sequence of events. Steve K. was driving west-bound along Holy Hill Rd., on 11/9/06 at 1:30am, and 15 yards west of the intersection of Troll Hill Road he found a dead deer. The deer wasn\\u2019t on his list of dead deer to pick up. He had just happened upon it and he figured he\\u2019d pick it up because he knew he would have to pick it up later. Steve K.  receives a list of dead deer locations faxed to him each morning. He lifted up the 80 \\u2013 100 lb dead doe himself, put it in the back of the pickup with the four other dead deer. He didn\\u2019t notice anything unusual about the dead deer and there weren\\u2019t any strange sounds around him. He got into the pickup, closed the door, reached for his clip board.  He didn\\u2019t have a chance to open the clipboard because that\\u2019s when he first felt the pickup shudder. He thought it was the wind. Almost instantaneously, it shuddered again. He instinctively looked up at the center mirror and saw a dark figure reaching into the bed of the pickup. He said it was all black, had a head that was a cross between a black bear and a wolf. Its ears were pointed straight up, not folded over. He knew it wasn\\u2019t a bear. He could see something like a muzzle, but he couldn\\u2019t see its eyes. He said it reached out with one \\u201carm\\u201d. He could not see \\\"whether it had claws or fingers or hands\\u201d. It had three-foot wide shoulders and described it as being \\u201cstocky\\u201d. He said it was about has tall as I am (5\\u201910\\u2019\\u2019) when it was reaching into the bed. I stood behind the pickup so he could gauge the height of what he had seen. He watched it at the most five seconds where the first couple of seconds he was trying to figure out what it was. The next few seconds fear was setting in. \\u201cIt scared the crap out of me\\u201d. Steve K. quickly pulled away and didn\\u2019t bother to look in the mirror as he left. He heard the ramp hit the ground as he headed west. When he set the deer in the pickup \\u2018it must have gotten tangled with the ramp\\u2019. The deer that was taken was the one that he had just put in. He went back five (5) minutes later and there was no deer, and no ramp. The reason he went back was, because he needed the ramp along with the remaining ramp in the pickup to wench in heavy deer in to the bed of the pickup. Background Info: Steve goes out every other night to pick up road kill. He drives 450 miles a night and picks up from 9 to 18 deer. He\\u2019s been doing this for 18 months and nothing like this has ever happened to him before. On occasion he\\u2019ll pick up a deer and hear scavengers in the bushes. Steve said, occasionally there won\\u2019t be a carcass to pick up at an assign spot, and he attributes that to a program called \\u201cEarn-A-Buck\\u201d. Washington county participates in a program where a person can bring in a dead doe and get a buck tag for it. He says the DNR knows that people are probably bringing in road kill to get the buck tag. He also laughingly suggested that people could be taking the road kill to eat. The deer that he picked up on that night wasn\\u2019t more than 2 hours old, as rigamortis had not set in. He could not tell if it was still warm because he was using gloves. On occasion he\\u2019d pick up deer that have been scavenged on, and the entrails will be gone. He can tell if a deer\\u2019s peritoneum cavity (gut) has been opened by something chewing on it, or if it\\u2019s been ripped open. He couldn\\u2019t say what would open a deer by ripping it open. He said that he could tell if something had been cut opened because he\\u2019s a deer hunter and knows what it looks like, and he has never seen that on road kill. Bear rarely venture that far south in the state. On the morning that I interviewed him, he said earlier in the night, he was at the intersection of Hwy 83 and Q, and he was picking up a deer. Steve said that had this uneasy feeling that something was watching him. Hwy 83 & Q is 4.5 miles southwest (as the crow flies) from where the dead deer was removed from his pickup. Last, I asked Steve what was the likelihood it was someone in a costume. He said, \\u2018that was so far out there as someone telling him that what he saw was something from a different dimension\\u2019.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Wisconsin\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 16564: Deer carcass nabbed from pickup truck in Erin (Hwy 167 at Station Way)\", \"latitude\": 43.251000000000005, \"longitude\": -88.3245, \"date\": \"2006-11-09T00:00:00\", \"number\": 16564.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dp9nn1s53f\", \"temperature_high\": 60.22, \"temperature_mid\": 48.095, \"temperature_low\": 35.97, \"dew_point\": 38.71, \"humidity\": 0.63, \"cloud_cover\": 0.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.65, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1005.85, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 9.59, \"wind_bearing\": 301.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.0, \"location\": \"POINT(-88.3245 43.251000000000005)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My girlfriend and I was returning home in the early morning hours, around 3am, on the date of June 28th 2009.

I noticed on my way down to the back pasture that my very large dogs had all of my goats in a tight knot by the small barn and the dogs were in a semi-circle around the goats.  When I got to the back, to let the other dog in, I noticed that there was no sound at all in the woods nearby.  My dogs were silent.

The next day the neighbor told me that my dogs had fought something behind his house at about 3 am.   He didn't know what it was, only that it was large.  When I checked my dogs out, they did not have the slash cuts they would have had, if they had tangled with a mountain lion.  There were scrapes but that was about it. Our fence at the back of the place was also pushed down.  Our fence consists of cattle panels that are 52\\\" tall.   They are hooked to the post with heavy wire ties.  I can not bend the ties with my bare hands.  At the place where the fence was pushed down, the panel was loose from the post and the clips were in the brush.   AT the time I thought it odd, as a mountain lion would not have been capable of doing this.  A bear could, but not a cougar.\", \"location_details\": \"I can show you the place where I saw it.\", \"county\": \"Barry County\", \"state\": \"Missouri\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 9840: Nighttime sighting on country dirt road\", \"latitude\": 36.8133, \"longitude\": -93.8232, \"date\": \"2004-12-06T00:00:00\", \"number\": 9840.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9yt33j8j0b\", \"temperature_high\": 58.71, \"temperature_mid\": 49.985, \"temperature_low\": 41.26, \"dew_point\": 51.97, \"humidity\": 0.95, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.81, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0232, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Rain starting in the evening.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 175.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.51, \"location\": \"POINT(-93.8232 36.8133)\"}, {\"observed\": \"In late Aug or early Sep 1993, about 1000 to 1100 pm, an unidentified large furry head (filled roughly 75% of the window measuring 20\\\" by 30\\\", so estimate the head size at about 12\\\" by 18\\\") looked in the back door of my wife's sister's house.  My wife, her sister, me, my daughter, and sister-in-law's daughter, all saw it.  We hadn't realized what we had seen at first.  When we saw it, we quickly let out their big dog and went outside where I immediately stepped into a big pile of fresh scat (looked and had texture similar to bear scat) and the area smelled sort of like a skunk was around the area.  The night was warm and no jackets were needed.  I don't remember much moon-light because it was very dark outside the glow of the small porch light.  The animal head we saw looked sort of like a primates, a large head with 4-6 inches of long silvery or gray hair but I don't recall much detail of the nose or mouth at the time, only a huge head that filled the window of the door. It looked in for only about three seconds, until we all had looked back at it and it apparently left.  It would have had to bend over to look in the window, since it was on the porch and the window is at the standard height.  I didn't think to look into the trees, but the odor was still very present.  We looked around, the girls yelling as if to scare away the intruder saying they would call the police.  I knew, after stepping in the scat, it was an animal and after gathering my thoughts, felt it better to get the family inside.  Also because the scat pile was fairly large, 6-7 inches diameter and about 3 inches high, thought it was a large animal but also knew from the head it was large.

I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass. Just before going to sleep I was standing outside my tent and I heard a loud noise behind me. The noise was within forty feet of my position, and I would describe it as a single pop sound. I\\u2019ll try to spell out the sound, but there is no way I can reproduce the sound! \\u201cPooeekk\\u201d. It could have been a branch being broken off of a tree but it would have had to come off at the base of the branch where it meets the tree trunk. The tree would have to be slightly hollow to get the sound. There was no noise after the initial sound and nothing ever hit the ground. My first impression of the sound was that it was a warning and I thought it was more of an animal sound, because it had a hollow guttural tone to the pop sound. I dismissed the occurrence and had no other problems through the night. The next morning I got up before sun up and started stocking along the tree line heading toward the mountain pass. After about 75 yards I moved into the trees and sat for some time looking over a meadow. Once I finished my time there I walked in the trees for twenty feet and then I moved out of the trees and back in the open. Just as I stepped out of the trees I spotted a large foot print. It was very large and I could make out two toes at the top left of the print. At this point I took out my cell phone and snapped a picture of the foot print. The foot print was as long as my boot, 13\\u201d long plus the toes and 2\\u201d wider than my boot on the side. I could make out a ridge in the dirt where the ball of the heal and the middle of the foot come together. After taking the picture I resumed my hunting and I moved along the tree line following the foot prints. They were made by a man like biped creature, the stride was longer than mine are, but I could stretch my stride to match the stride. I followed the prints for about another 75 yards they went right through the middle of the saddle between the two mountains.  At that point I resumed my hunting for deer and dismissed the Bigfoot. The only thing I would add about the prints they were all the same, but I could only see the toes on the first print because that print went slightly into the side of the mound. I will send a copy of the picture once you make contact with me. Both the toes and skin fold mound can be seen in the digital picture.\", \"location_details\": \"The area is located south of the Sherman Pass Road about a one hour drive out of Kernville.

Approximately 4:30 pm as the light was fading, I heard two loud, distinct \\\"cries\\\" or \\\"yells\\\" that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking, the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell, but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the \\\"yell\\\" again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on \\\"alert\\\" from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped, then again for another 30 seconds.  Since I did not see anything, I sat there (somewhat in disbelief) armed with a high powered rifle.

As my friend and I were walking from his house along his 1/4 mile driveway that meandered through the woods along side of the creek we had heard some odd noises that caught our attention. At this point, we had been running through the woods for a few years together, felt extremely comfortable in them and knew many sounds and sign. Neither of us could identify these sounds. I do not recall the sounds exactly, but, it seemed to be some tapping noise, somewhat subtle and not alarming, yet it seemed clearly something out of the ordinary. So we decided to hop the old overgrown fence which paralleled the driveway, penetrate the overgrowth and go into the woods to investigate. Heading in the direction from which the sounds had been coming we soon noticed that some of the patches of grass that had managed to grow under the canopy of trees was matted down. The matting looked quite fresh as all the blades were still quite green and showing no signs of atrophy or recovery. While clearly other patches of grass nearby were exactly as one would expect, not matted down. We then spread out a little bit as we normally did when investigating the woods. Shortly after this I spotted a footprint, classic human shape with five toes, in some dried mud. Clear as day, there it was. Unlike the fresh appearance of the matted grass, this had been here awhile as the \\\"mud\\\" which had originally received the print was now thoroughly dry.  I called my friend over while I looked at it thinking, this doesn't make any sense, who else would be back here and why would they be barefooted? We again spread out and now I was head down and focused on finding more foot prints. Shortly thereafter, I heard a crash in the trees and my friend yelled, \\\"Run, run for your life!\\\" And maybe it was this comment that etched the memory of that day firmly onto the memory banks. I could tell in my close friends voice that he was dead serious. For that matter, he was never a BSer anyway. I lit out of there, running through the underbrush, past trees and hopped the old fence at a faster pace before or probably since. Reaching the relatively safety of the clearing the driveway offered and turned and yelled encouragements for my friend to get out of there. I could see him now, emerging from the underbrush, the expressions on his face said this was no joke. Just as I saw him begin to emerge and before he hopped the fence a large crash of breaking timber happened from directly behind him. Although overgrowth was relatively dense, I could see he wasn't causing the sounds of the smashing logs. Something had apparently broken a good sized tree or log directly behind him. There was no mistaking the sound of it, or the movement in the undergrowth behind him and to his right, but, what it was remained shrouded by the forest growth.  He made it across the fence and upon reaching where I was apprehensively standing, snapped back around and we stood shoulder to shoulder peering into the forest both uncertain of what exactly had just happened. I do know these to be certain:  Fact: Unidentified sounds were coming from the woods.  Fact: The grass had the appearance of being freshly matted  Fact: There was what looked to be a human footprint completely intact and showed the entire outline of a foot with five toes. It seemed only 10-12 inches long  Fact: Something or somebody was smashing up some decent sized logs and it wasn't us.  Fact: Somebody who doesn't scare easy was sure spooked that day.  Fact: An Illinois State Trooper came out that day to investigate our story. The trooper seemed to lose interest when my friend said that whatever he saw was about 7' tall.  The Unknown:  Was it a hippy, hillbilly or prankster who simply liked to walk barefooted around woods that had old rusty barbed wire among other occasional rusty or sharp artifacts?

I was approximately 14 or 15 years old at the time, I am fifty now, however the incident is still fresh in my mind.  At that time there was nothing for a young boy to do so my favorite pastime was wandering the military reservation and search for discarded C rations as we never had enough to eat in the house.There was 8 people in my family.  One day I had skipped school to go C ration hunting.  I never will forget that day, it was very warm and sunny, which for North Carolina is not unusual for a fall day.  We used to call it indian summer.  I had been wandering the deeper recesses of the reservation and was quite proud of the fact that not only had I stumbled across old farmsteads that the Marine corps had condemed in order to take the land but had a pretty good supply of discarded C rations.  Realizing it was getting late and I had better get home, I hit a tank trail made by the marines for thier vehicles to use.  I was getting closer to home so I decided to leave the trail and short cut it through the woods.  I knew this particular area and always avoided it because it was known as a pocosin, which in local terms meant an area that is real dense and swampy.  As I made my way in to the pocosin something really seemed out of the ordinary, all day I was used to hearing the sounds of the forest, birds, frogs squirrels chattering and what was great not seeing another human being. Now it was so quiet it didn't seem natural.  Something made me stop and to this very day I am perplexed about this I don't know why because at that age you have no fear as you think you are going to live forever.  I had no fear this time either however I felt that I was being watched.  I have never had this feeling again.  I slowly started to turn my head to the right when I caught a glimpse of brown.  My first thought was oh its only a deer.  I stood stock still and kept looking at the brown patch and it didnt move.  It was in a VERY dense part of the pocosin and my second thought was maybe its not a deer but possibly a discarded marine corps field jacket.  Now that would be a treasure, as I started to go towards the object I seem to hear the crashing of brush first then that brown patch moved, only it moved higher.  I  estimate a height of between 8 and 10 feet.  As it grew in height it also grew broader exposing more of itself.  I never saw its head or any real features other than the long fur because that thing was moving so fast through that pocosin that I was amazed how any animal that size could do that.  The crashing of the branches and underbrush was loud and I all I could do was stand there.

It is about 1/4 mile up the highway on the side of the road. At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing. As I got closer, I see that it was clearly not a man. But just before I got a better look, it slipped down the side of the road into the ravine. And that was when I knew what I had just seen. The way it moved was sylph-like. Almost as if it shimmered away. I looked back to where it had been, and it had completely disappeared. Now, if that isn't enough for you, there's more. About two miles further up the mountain pass, I saw another. It was a little smaller, but moved in the same graceful manner as it quickly went down the side of the mountain out of my view. The leaves on the tree that it had been next to still gently shook as I drove by. I cannot say with any surety what these creatures looked like exactly. But they were definitely not bears - too tall and far too graceful. They were not human - too graceful and quick. They were both dark though. If they were at all reddish, I did not notice. They both seemed to be very dark brown. The smaller one darker than the bigger one. If I was to guess size, I would say the larger one was 6'4\\\" - 6'8\\\" and probably around 250 - 300 lean pounds. The smaller was perhaps 6'0? And around 200 lbs maybe? The thing that was so completely out of the ordinary, was the manner in which they moved. I have never seen something so large move so fluidly.

My father, brother and I were camped at the head of Swampy Draw on Pleasant Valley creek during the cow elk muzzle loader season. Camp location: 16.5 miles N by NW of Dubois Idaho as the crow flies. Camp was at 7,054 ft elevation. General topography is pine covered mountainsides with grassy / mixed alder brush and sage brush valley floors. We had been hunting elk and deer for 5 days and saw lots of deer on the hillside above camp ~ 250 yards away (from range finder) and a few elk. After spending days exploring around the area we decided to hunt the deer right at camp. My father is 83 and walks with a cane so he hunts close to camp. For the evening hunt my father walked up the hill behind camp ~100 yards and my brother positioned himself a few hundred yards along the base of the hillside. I decided to take my atv up swampy draw and sit at the head of it for the evening. That way we would have a fairly large area covered. Swampy Draw has an old logging road right up the middle of it but the access from Pleasant Valley is difficult. I managed to get up the road on my atv leaving camp at 2:30pm as I wanted to be in hunting position early and let the area quiet down way before prime hunting hours. Prior to the evening hunt I explored a skid road that climbed the east side of the draw and hooked north toward camp. The climb disturbed the area so I headed back down to the main logging road then turned up to the head of Swampy Draw and positioned myself for the evening hunt. At 6:15pm I saw 2 figures coming up the trail towards me at approximately 200 yards. I thought it was 2 hunters that were blowing my evening hunt. But as they came into full view I saw that they were black in color. Most hunters in the area have some sort of blaze orange on them or are dressed in camo. These figures were not dressed. They were walking side by side and I suspect they were a male and female pair although the distance was too great to identify sex. I estimate the height of one at approximately 8 foot and the other 7-1/2 foot. I could not see any facial features at my observation distance. My overall impression was that they were incredibly tall and rather slender. As they saw me they turned to my left and disappeared into timbered hill side. As they turned and walked into the timber I saw very long arms, almost to the knees. They swung their arms in fairly long arcs as they walked; much like a human power walker. It was then that I remembered that I had left my 454 Casull pistol in camp and only had the single shot 54 cal muzzle loader with me. A over sight I will never duplicate. The whole sighting took approximately 20 seconds. Since the creatures were between myself and camp with only one way out I waited 10 min for them to hopefully clear the area. I put my rifle across my lap and headed back to camp. Distance to camp was only a bit over a half mile. Half way to camp I came across a road block on the trail in a small creek that had not been there when I came in. The creatures had picked up a large log and placed it in the creek to block my way. As it was getting dark, with a bit of adrenaline and heavy handed throttle I managed to climb my ATV over the smaller end of the tree. The next day I went back to the barricade only to find that during the night the creatures had improved on their efforts and completely blocked the trail with additional logs and stumps. The logs that they placed in the trail were too heavy for 3 men to pick up and I could find no evidence of dragging. They were picked up and carried, an enormous feat. To make the story a bit weirder, my father kept talking about a stick fort that some kids must of made about 200 yards from camp at the base of the hill. My brother said it must have been made by some Boy Scouts. But nobody uses the area. I went and found the stick structure and it was clearly evident that it was not man made. The main structural tree was pulled down in an arc and no 3 men would have the strength to perform the task. Masses of sticks were then woven into the frame to produce a hollow area approximately 6 feet by 12 feet. My father said it looked like it had been recently used. I think that the course of events were as follows. I came up the logging road on my ATV, explored the spur road that climbed the hill toward camp and close above the stick structure. I disturbed the creatures and they built the barricade. Then they came up the road and showed themselves to me as if to say \\u2013 Hey here we are and you should not be. I never went past the barricade again. I looked very closely for foot prints but could not find any clear prints in the hard gravelly ground. Of note: The evening of the sighting my brother and father counted over 30 deer on the hillside in the area of the structure. After my sighting we saw no more deer during the 4 days we continued hunting. Also during the night I heard my horse trailer tack door open and shut which I thought was odd. I stored the camp food in the tack room and nothing was missing. I know I had the door tightly shut in case of the odd bear wandering into camp. It takes fingers to work the latch and the door was not latched when I found it in the morning. A bit about me: I am 62 years old and have spent a lifetime hunting and fishing in the wilds. Mostly Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska and Northern Minnesota. I have had other what I believe were close encounters but this is the only time I have clearly observed the creatures.

We loaded our gear in the back and headed back to base camp as the others left to go back into the woods to do some further research. Interested in getting back to base camp and getting warm, and much needed sleep, I was concentrating on watching for animals in the roadway, as I didn't want us to hit something and be stuck out there in the cold. Mike was driving and there was no conversation until we topped a hill in the road, and I saw something moving in the same direction that we were in the middle of the road. I pointed and asked \\\"what is that?\\\". Mike slowed and asked \\\"what is what?\\\" and I answered \\\"that thing in the road just beyond the headlights.\\\" Mike looked and said \\\"holy s---!\\\" and I said \\\"whatever it is don't hit it.\\\" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road. It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling. It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders. It was very very broad at the shoulders and thick (massive). It never turned to look at us, so I don't know what the face looked like. We have no recollection of its hands or lower body, our focus was on how wide it was and how smooth that it moved. It was amazing, just very graceful. No jerky movements, very fluid in its movement. As we neared, it moved to the side of the road in a smooth motion then stepped off into the ditch and into the woods to the right side of the road. Then Mike realizing what we were witnessing, stopped the jeep and grabbed the gun and flashlight and jumped out to look for tracks. I stayed in the jeep not believing what I was seeing with it running. As mike scanned the woods following sounds he was hearing, he motioned for me to cut the engine and waved for me to get out an join him. I did both reluctantly. As I got near Mike he asked for me to look where he was shining his flashlight and to tell him what I saw, to my utter disbelief I saw a large shape of head and shoulders move quickly between two trees and disappear. I must have blinked because it was there one second and gone the next. We scanned the woods and the road for any signs but couldn't see anything, we also listened for movement but it was dead quiet. We then moved back into the jeep and just sat there, amazed at what we had just witnessed. There was no odor and no sound, other that what Mike had heard before I got out of the jeep. In reflection on the event I did have the feeling that we were being watched. Mike was so excited over this he could hardly think, so I grabbed a pad and pen and said to him, \\\"Here let's write down what we saw.\\\" He was so shaken that he couldn't even write, so I took over and had him dictate what he saw and added what I saw. Not having any way to communicate with the others in the woods, we didn't know what to do. Not thinking clearly because of the excitement and lack of sleep we drove back to base camp, where we were headed in the 1st place. Upon reaching camp, I just couldn't face another cold night on the ground and begged Mike to take me into town to a nice warm hotel.

The base camp was next to a river in the mountains near the Virginia border. On Thursday afternoon most of the people crossed the river by canoe in order to hike down the trail along the opposite bank of the river.  After that group set off, Steve, my husband, headed out in his truck with a big handheld radio to see if he could reach the others who had walked down the river trail. I was alone in the base camp. After about a half hour I went outside and stood at the nose of the camper and looked up the road to see if Steve had driven away, then I turned around to go to the river.  I looked through the trees and saw what I first thought were two people from the river group coming back up the trail, around the bend in the river trail.  I walked straight over to the river's edge to get ready to take pictures of them crossing back over in the canoe. When I got to the riverbank I looked across and saw no one, which was surprising. There was no place to hide along the river trail for the next 200 yards. One side of the trail was the riverbank. The other side was the jagged rock face of the river canyon. From the ground upward, the rock face was mostly bare for about the first 15 feet. Then there was thick mountain laurel the rest of the way up, covering the rock outcroppings and ledges. You could not get out of view unless you were to climb up into the mountain laurel above the trail.  It was a near vertical climb, but there was no other way they could have vanished so quickly in any other direction. Then I started thinking about the figures I saw.  They had looked pretty slender, but it was a cold day. Everyone was bundled up for cold and rain and looked a bit \\u201cplump\\u201d.   The figures I saw seemed lanky with a lazy walk. They were also walking into the sunlight when they came around the bend, but I didn't see any color \\u2013 no clothes, no light skin, no sneakers, no hats, etc.  They were tree-trunk dark. The taller one was walking closest to the hillside; the shorter one was closer to the river. Steve returned to the camp and I asked him to radio to the group that walked down the river. They had walked past that same bend and would have noticed anyone walking up the trail in the opposite direction. The river group responded and said no one passed them in the oppositive direction. They said anything coming around that bend must have come down from the side of the canyon, then climbed back up the canyon wall. They offered to walk back to that point to provide some scale, for me to compare the height. They asked me to return to where I had been standing when I saw the figures. I went back to the same spot. The river group radioed that they were coming around the bend in the trail. They said to look over at them as they came into view.  When I did it immediately struck me that they appeared much smaller than the figures I saw. There were other things about their appearance that sharply contrasted with the figures I saw. I could see the gaps of air between their arms and torso -- unlike the humans who were so bundled up with rain gear that you could not see any gaps betwen their arms and torsos.

We were driving south on US 441 in an unpopulated area at about 65mph. We were about halfway between Homerville and Fargo  which is slightly west of the Okefenokee Swamp . It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight. There were no other lights visible anywhere and no houses or businesses anywhere around.  My wife had turned on the map light because we were getting low on gas and we needed to check the distance to the nearest probable area for gas. She was looking down at the map and didn't see it,  but she  sure smelled it.  Years before , we had been camping in the Okefenokee Swamp and were aware of the wildlife diversity. I have hunting , camping , and Brazilian jungle experience and I am not easily frightened, but this shook me up.   It was an instinctive reaction similar to when you have a surprise encounter with a poisonous snake. I saw a very dark brown/black constant colored tall humanoid figure standing on the left shoulder of the road , quarter facing toward the road and toward the direction of our travel. The figure was standing still,  very vertically erect with both arms loosely down at its sides. I couldn't see any facial features or individual features of hands or feet. I estimate it to be about 7 ft. tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. It was lanky rather than stocky and was not crouching forward , but was standing very vertical. The smell coming into the car vent was very powerfull and was a combination of sewerlike and a strong musky animal odor. There was a small animal roadkill a few yards down the highway that was fresh , so that wouldn't account for the fowl odor. We conjectured that the creature had smelled the roadkill and came out of the woods to investigate. The hair on the head was long and stringy, but the rest of the body hair seemed only two or three inches long and layed down rather than sticking out in a fuzzy fashion. The thing that struck me was that I couldn't see any facial features or varied colors around the hand areas. We thought about turning around to re- investigate,  but in the middle of the night , I frankly didn't think it was prudent.  We proceeded to the next major intersection to buy gas, and I asked the station employees if anyone else had mentioned something unusual or if there were any kind of unusual wildlife sightings in the area. They answered \\\"no\\\".  That was the end of our incident. All but one of the sketches I have ever seen of creatures anything like this , showed a more stocky crouching ape-like creature. What I saw was a tall, lanky , humanoid  creature that looked almost \\\"helmeted\\\" because of the way the head hair fell straight down similar to a woman with long straight hair.

We filled up the truck and headed back up towards Raven Cliff to find a camp site for the night.  We found a small dirt road that had been barricaded with a large dirt birm.  We drove over the birm and drove into the forest.  We drove until we had a half tank of gas which put us several miles back in.

I had an experience 24 yrs. ago that I will never forget. When it first happened, I shared the details with family and a few close friends but no one believed me. It became a topic of such ridicule that I just stopped talking about it (what was the point). I've always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema. When I moved (in 1974) to south florida, neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a \\\"skunk-ape\\\") roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting. They said it was large (about 9'), smelly and a very swift runner. This all seemed too bizarre and I really didn't believe them. Then when I was 15 yrs. old I had my experience. I'm not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape, but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here's my story .... I was with my family on a summer camping trip at Johnathan Dickinson State Park (just north of Jupiter, Fl). There was an observation tower (about 30 ft high) along the same road that leads to the campground. About 5:30 or 6:00 pm I jogged from the campground to the tower alone (it was probably 2 to 3 miles). When I got there, the fence around the tower was locked. Since this was an un-manned tower setback from a road that had very little traffic (in-fact the entire time I was gone from camp, there were no cars), I decided I would hop the fence. I'm not one for blatantly breaking rules, so I was very careful not to make too much noise climbing the fence. When I got to the top of the tower, there was a built-in wood bench that wrapped along the perimeter of the deck (about 12'X 12'). I spent about 5-10 minutes looking in all directions (but there wasn't much to see). The skys were clear and there was about 45 minutes to an hour of sunlight left. There was a clearing of low-lying brush (about 3-4 ft high) that extended out from the tower for about 30-50 yds. in all directions. At that point it became pretty densely wooded. It was peaceful up there and I was tired so I rested for about 20-30 minutes by laying down on the bench. When I got up, I noticed the sunlight was beginning to fade so I figured I'd better get moving. I remember being upset with myself for staying so long because I would not make it back to camp until nightfall and I didn't want my parents to worry. When I got to the base of the tower, I climbed the 8' high fence at a point that was perpendicular to the road. Once on the other side, I could walk the 100' or so along the fenceline to the road. Unfortunately, I slipped at the top of the fence so I instinctively pushed off the fence and dropped to the ground on the other side. When I came down, I landed in a bush which made a lot of noise (I had been deliberately very quiet up til that moment. The position of my body was slouched over and facing away from the fence towards the woods beyond the low brush. It seemed as soon as I hit the ground, making all that noise, something popped its head up from under the brush (about 25 yds. away) and I saw it immediately because I just happened to be looking in that direction. I saw just its head at first and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. At first, I was not sure whether I was looking at an animal's head or a person's head. I remember it was rounded at the bottom and more elongated towards the top. It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair. Its face seemed human with a flat nose, its eyes were small and dark. It made no sound. After a few seconds of silent starring, it turned towards the road and began moving quickly. It seemed to be running on all fours at first; but after about 10 yds. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods. I would guess that it was about 6-7' tall. It's frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair. After it was out of sight, I stood there for a moment trying to rationalize what I had seen. I saw it clear enough to know what it wasn't. It wasn't a man - it was definitely an animal. It wasn't a bear, deer or panther. Not even close. Surprise had turned to confusion and was now becoming fear. I didn't want to hang around (defenseless) against an animal larger, stronger and faster than myself. I ran back to camp, checking behind me as I ran. By the way it had reacted, I assumed it was probably as scared of me as I was of it. When I reached camp, I tried to tell my family, but they just laughed it off and said it was probably a dog or a homeless man. Of course, I knew this was not the case, so I became upset. Not wanting to continue the conversation, my father became stern and so I dropped the subject. The next day we went home and I've never been back. Until recently, I've pretty much kept this story to myself over the past 24 yrs. When I found your site (and some others)on the internet and read of other encounters it motivated me to share my experience. I sent info about my experience to a web-site dedicated to finding \\\"skunk-apes\\\", but I really found much of their material to be uncredible. I wanted to share my experience on this site because I feel your opinions and observations are genuine, thoughtful and reserved. P.S. I remember watching the local news one night (around 1977) about a supposed skunk-ape sighting by not less than 14 people during an air-boat ride thru the everglades. They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp. I thought having so many witnesses would have made this a more credible and compelling sighting. Although I have read of many sightings in Florida which matched the stories my neighbors told me when I was younger, I have never seen or read anything (on the internet) about the airboat sighting. Have you or any of your readers ever heard of this sighting. Perhaps it was proven later to be a hoax or a mis-identification.\", \"location_details\": \"The entrance to the park is off US 1.

It was very cold and very early in the morning at around 4 a.m. When we arrived at the gates to our property me and my stepfather exited our vehicle and applied a last coat of scent blocker from our heads to our toes then applied raccoon urine to the soles of our boots. We entered our property and began walking through the first 40-acre field. At the far side of the field my stepfather settled into his hunting blind, leaving me to continue on to my hunting spot alone. It was about another 3/4 or 1 mile past my step dads hunting blind to my hunting spot. I walked mostly by memory of the trails of our land using my flashlight only when I absolutely had to, which was a maximum of 5 times and for a only a few seconds each time. I reached my hunting spot by about 430 or 445 a.m. I settled into my usual hunting spot at the base of what we call the East Hill. I remember that I picked that spot because the wind that day was blowing to the east/south-east and the deer generally walked out north of that spot. It had a excellent sight line down the left side of the creek on our property (which I believe was north) under a large tree with lots of brush grown in front of it. There was no moon that night. It was around 5 to 5:15 in the morning, but still so dark that I could not see my hand in front of my face. After being there for 15-20 minutes I began noticing the sound of footsteps coming from my right down the hill. Even though they sounded very far off, the distinct heavy and slow footsteps made me to wonder what it was. It definitely sounded like it was walking on 2 legs.  It could not have been a horse or cow and no goat was heavy enough to produce the foot sounds that I heard. Bear have never been spotted anywhere in this region so it didn't take long for the frightening realization to set into to me that this might be a bigfoot. I fully cocked my 30-30 rifle and pointed it in the direction of the footsteps.  It still sounded like it may have been as much as 15 yards away but was steadily moving in my direction with pauses every so often for up to a minute. One pause was so long that I had thought it had snuck off, but suddenly its distance to me had jumped from 10 or 12 yards away to about 5 yards away.  I later discovered that there was a very large flat rock breaking the surface of the ground about 10 yards from me in that direction. I was becoming extremely nervous at this point but the sounds still moved closer. I began to hear heavy breath sounds from the animal as it was getting closer. It sounded labored or very deep with a heavy exhale. I estimate that it was 10 feet from me or so when it took one last step. It then seemed as if it finally realized I was there, because it turned so quickly to leave that it tripped or slipped. It sounded like it fell down and hit the ground hard with a thud, then scrambled to get up.  It ran away with what sounded like a long heavy stride which faded away quickly in the distance in the same direction it came from. I waited till daylight to go looking for evidence. The only evidence I found was what appeared to be the spot were it fell on the ground. The distance from my hunting spot to the spot where I believed it fell and came out to be 11 feet. I hunted for about 1 hour after that but couldn\\u2019t stand to be in the area any longer. Also, there was not 1 single animal in the area, not even the squirrels that usually run free along the trees near the creek during that time of year.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Coryell County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 15696: Possible stalking of hunter near Gatesville\", \"latitude\": 31.37756, \"longitude\": -97.59946, \"date\": \"2004-12-01T00:00:00\", \"number\": 15696.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9vdde045x9\", \"temperature_high\": 57.38, \"temperature_mid\": 46.025000000000006, \"temperature_low\": 34.67, \"dew_point\": 31.45, \"humidity\": 0.69, \"cloud_cover\": 0.03, \"moon_phase\": 0.65, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1025.93, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 9.66, \"wind_bearing\": 176.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.28, \"location\": \"POINT(-97.59946 31.37756)\"}, {\"observed\": null, \"location_details\": \"We were in the forest near our campground doing some hiking when the sighting occurred\", \"county\": \"Valley County\", \"state\": \"Idaho\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 62182: Dusk sighting by hikers in general vicinity of Tamarack Ski Resort\", \"latitude\": 44.66862, \"longitude\": -116.1155, \"date\": \"2018-11-21T00:00:00\", \"number\": 62182.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9rvqjexm8d\", \"temperature_high\": 42.13, \"temperature_mid\": 37.945, \"temperature_low\": 33.76, \"dew_point\": 16.39, \"humidity\": 0.59, \"cloud_cover\": 0.27, \"moon_phase\": 0.45, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1019.59, \"summary\": \"Foggy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 1.24, \"wind_bearing\": 128.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.83, \"location\": \"POINT(-116.1155 44.668620000000004)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was home alone at the time watching t.v in the living room when i got a phone call from a family member that lives on the hill behind me saying my cousin's girlfriend had heard the screams. which I had heard before a few times actually.

What was odd, however, was that a turkey would let me approach that closely.  As I got closer to the clucking sound, I heard a very low, gutteral growl coming from the brush.  I couldn't see anything.  This growl really surprised and scared me.  I began walking away, but then curiosity got the better of me and I approached the area slowly again.  Once again, as I got closer, the low growl occurred.  Black bears are commonly seen around this area, but I can't imagine that a black bear would simply hold still that close to a human and growl.  Whatever was growling at me was very well concealed because I couldn't see a thing.  So after hearing this growl two or three times, I got freaked out and left.

How I came to believe what I saw was Gigantopethicus or something very like it took time to develop and just tonight (June 26, 2007) after reading the news item about the expedition to the UP of Michigan, finding your site and then seeing Bill Munns model of Giganto on http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/giganto.html I'm convinced I saw something out of the ordinary. After driving in from our home in NY my daughter and I were staying in a cabin for a few days at the Staunton River State Park, VA with a friend of hers from VA. On the night in question I had to drive to Danville to pick up and bring back another daughter who was coming up from Greensboro to stay with us for the weekend. Her bus didn't pull in to Danville until around 11PM so I left the park around 9PM. It was a dark, rainy drive with some patchy but not heavy fog. Because of the conditions and my unfamiliarity with the road I concentrated more on driving than noticing much of the surroundings. At some point around 1/2 way I was coming around a wide bend to the left when my headlights fell upon a broadside view of what I first thought was a huge dog, just off the road moving from left to right. It simply turned it head to look at the lights and lumbered slowly but deliberately towards the treeline. It was then I realized it was no dog. Maybe a lion? It had huge eyes like a lion as well as a mane. But it wasn't shaped like a lion, it was big in the front, big head, big shoulders and chest but more streamlined to the rear. Walking on all fours but not like a dog or big cat. The front legs seemed taller than the rear. If you remember the monster in the scifi movie 'Forbidden Planet' you'll have pretty good idea of it's shape, not of course as exaggerated as that but similar. It did not appear startled or afraid, it simply walked in towards the trees while watching my car drive past. Since then I had no idea what it could have been until I read something about Gigantopethicus and saw a pic of a statue of it on all fours on a website. That statue I thought was close but no cigar. Then tonight I found the Bill Munns picture with the model in color and it clicked. It was very much the same coloring, mane, head and eyes. The only difference was the size, what I saw was huge, on all fours maybe almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle but if it stood up not quite so tall...but then again the sighting was only seconds before I had to return my attention to navigating the rest of the turn at maybe 40 miles per hour. \", \"location_details\": \"Location was about 1/2 way between Staunton River State Park and Danville, VA. on Rt 58 at a fairly sharp left-hand bend in the road\", \"county\": \"Halifax County\", \"state\": \"Virginia\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 19906: Traveller observes lumbering figure along roadside near Danville\", \"latitude\": 36.589, \"longitude\": -79.1345, \"date\": \"2003-04-19T00:00:00\", \"number\": 19906.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dnx8pkb42e\", \"temperature_high\": 53.1, \"temperature_mid\": 51.760000000000005, \"temperature_low\": 50.42, \"dew_point\": 45.43, \"humidity\": 0.87, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.61, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1026.08, \"summary\": \"Light rain in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 5.6, \"wind_bearing\": 31.0, \"wind_speed\": 5.69, \"location\": \"POINT(-79.1345 36.589)\"}, {\"observed\": \"hello..I was on vacation in north Az. the White Mountains..I started to fish early...7 am...I heard a noise...this was not a animal....I am from Michigan...I live now in Idaho.......this was the most loud and powerful...\\\"SCREAM\\\"!!!...I EVER HEARD!!!...THE NORTH AZ.

First I must say that I don't think a bigfoot lives real close to where I live but I do think we live within it's (plural) normal range or migration route. The first sighting was in 1998 in the winter, we are not really sure...  My brother was driving home and was on our private driveway when he drove by something that he could not describe.  He walked in andsaid he had just saw a bear or a big black person wearing animal fur, or a cow...  Basically his mind could not fit what he saw into any specific category  and he was very confused.  Upon questioning him he said it looked like a homeless person wearing animal skins.  He said they passed right by eachother going in opposite directions.  Since our road is a graveled one lane road they must have been within a couple of feet from eachother! He told me it had just happened so we went to investigate.  I was thinking there was a homeless person passing through... But then we turned a corner and I saw the footprint from about 50ft away!  I was so amazed that I stopped my truck and got out and immediately took off my shoe and sock to compare sizes...  I was not thinking about a bigfoot, it didn't really cross my mind until a couple of years later actually...  I was still thinking it was a homeless person with huge barefeet!  I'm a size 12, I put my foot inside this track...  It was 4-6 inches longer and 3-4 inches wider than my foot.  And it was sunk into a hard pack dirt road about an inch or more.  Being 200lbs myself, I jumped around trying to make an impression an inch deep in this strata but to no avail.  I couldn't sink my own track at all! I mean no inches, nada!  So now I was thinking about a homeless person wearing animal skins with huge feet and that was significantly heavier than me...  But there were two problems to this obvious bigfoot sighting (in hindsight)... Number one, bigfoot do not live so far south in California (or so I thought), and my brother did not come in and say, \\\"I just saw a bigfoot!\\\"  So it never occurred to either of us that this was a bigfoot sighting!!!  It wasn't until a couple of years later that I asked him if what he saw could have been a bigfoot and he said,\\\" oh yeah, that makes sense now...\\\"  It took us awhile to put 2 and 2 together but we finally did with the help of this website.  I found it while web surfing and his sighting started to make sense...  Then I became more aware of my surroundings in relation to bigfoot.  We live in a typical second growth redwood forest with all the typical animals that I see quite often.  But I was never looking for bigfoot until now. 2004 was an exciting year.  We had 2 more sightings and a very loud vocal performance!  So, I was watching tv outside in the covered porch/ gazebo.  If you turn down the tv you can hear all of the night sounds as if you were outside.  Around 11:30ish pm  I heard something so I turned the tv off.  I then heard a very loud screaming roar right in front of my house.  And judging from the location of the first sound I heard that was distorted by the tv, I deduced that whatever this was was walking down my driveway and was very close!  It roared twice more while following the road.  I was dumbfounded!!!  And then I got scared... I've lived in the woods my whole life and think nothing of walking around in the dark with out a flashlight.  You couldn't have dragged me outside at this point!  I'm 6'3, 220lbs, and this thing sounded huge. I compare the roar to the decibel level of a siren!  It just echoed off the hills.  I have compared it to the recordings on this sight and it is very close to the Washington recordings, especially the one from 2005.  I am so glad that my dad and mom both heard this!  It just gave you the impression that it had huge lungs to make such a loud noise!  But interestingly enough the last roar was ended with two very clear dog barks that I presume were mimicked...  All of the dogs in the vicinty were going crazy except the dogs that were the closest to where this thing had traveled... Two nights later was the second sighting.  This time it was in the front yard of my Dads house.  I was leaving in my Suburban.  I was just edging down the driveway when I got something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and looked at what appeared to be a large pile of redwood bark lying in the yard as if my dad had cut down one of his trees and had raked all the bark into a pile.  Redwood bark is reddish...  As I passed slowly by I realized that my dad had not cut down any of his trees and that there would be no reason for a large pile of redwood bark to be piled there.  What I have deduced is that a bigfoot was balled up hiding from me!  And it semi worked.  There was a fence between us and if I were in a smaller car I wouldn't have seen it, but I was very high up in a raised Suburban so I could see over the fence.  It looked as if it was on it's knees hunched over with its head on the ground and it's arms over it head.  I say semi worked because I kept driving and didn't realize what I had seen until a couple of minutes later.  When I went back my pile of redwood bark had disapeared.  I was so disapointed because I was only about 15 ft away! The next sighting I again missed out by seconds!  My wife and I were driving on our driveway and she said she had just I contact with someone...  I had driven about 30 more ft and stopped. I asked her and she said she saw a dark face with deep inset eyes and a shaggy head looking at her from behind a tree.  The windows of the car were still dewed up from the cold morning so I backed up and got out.  I heard bi pedal footsteps walking away through the oak leaves.  It was a very definitive sound...  I would have followed if I was not in business clothes... So I think a bigfoot or more lives in the area.

My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now. I downloaded the \\\"Howl.wav\\\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely 'organic' in origin.

I was fishing at a pond in an open field across from some apartments that my grandparents and I were staying at until our house was ready. I had been fishing for about an hour when I got the feeling that someone or something was watching me. I wasn't in a secluded area, but there was no one else around. No activity at all from anybody. All of a sudden the birds and normal animal noises silenced like they do when a predator comes around. I could feel something watching me. I looked back to the south across the field to the fence line that divided the field. Along the fence line were several cedars ranging from 6 ft to 15 ft or so. I stared at what I thought was a small group of trees when something stepped out from them towards the fence. It was dark brown almost black with grass and debris in its hair like it had been laying down. It came up to the fence and watched me from beside a cedar tree, almost blending in with them. Frozen in fear all I could do was stare back. When it moved again I ran. I left my fish and my stuff right where it was. I ran for the fence that bordered the apts. I jumped the fence and ran home. I told my grandparents what had happened. To my surprise they sort of believed me. My Grandfather would not venture out at dusk to retrieve my gear, he said we would get it in the morning. The next morning we returned early to find that my tackle box had been knocked around like a toy, my rod was undisturbed, but my stringer of perch was gone.

DC and I were from out of state but JG was a regular camper there. We went 12 miles up the forest service rd. and picked a campsite. We saw no one else that day and it was a dead-end road. JG said it was the first time he'd been there alone. We spent the day hiking around and cooking meat over the campfire. We did not see or hear anything unusual that day other than a partial horse skeleton. At about midnight, we were winding down when we heard three, 2-tone howls to the hill approx. 1/4 mile to our north. We knew it was not a coyote but almost sounded like a person trying to imitate a coyote because it had a deeper bass tone. About five minutes later, we heard the same thing again. Then I heard something like a gunshot in the same area but there was no sonic crack. It was like something hit a tree really hard. Both sounds came from the same place as the first set of howls. We were all standing around the fire wondering what it was. JG had his shotgun in hand and we were all starting to get a little edgy. We all are police/former police/former military so it takes a lot to get any of us \\\"edgy.\\\" We all have camping experience and none of us had ever experienced anything like this before. About five minutes later, directly to our west, was a very loud 2-tone howl approx. 100 yds. away. It howled again and it was closer so it was closing in on us. DC and I drew our pistols and flashlights and all of us focused on the logging rd. that it/they would have to cross to get to us. There was a bright full moon so the open areas were well illuminated. It howled one more 2-tone howl before stopping at what we estimated to be 50 yds. away in the woodline. It seemed like it covered at least 50 yds. going through the woods while howling three times. Whatever it was was BIG and LOUD! There was a lot more bass to the howls than a dog/coyote/wolf has. Each time it howled it was 2-tone, in a series of three and it seemed unemotional or intelligent. About a minute later, another series of three 2-toned howls came from the hill to the south approx. 1/4 mile away. It seemed to be answering the one hiding in the treeline in front of us. Then the one in the treeline let out three more of the same howls. Let me stress again, this thing was LOUD! We were all pretty shaken. We felt that we had aroused at least three, big things that were communicating among themselves and closing in on us. We were all facing out from a dying fire with weapons and flashlights drawn. We didn't know if we were being studied or they were getting in position for attack. We decided to leave. After some debate, we decided to pack the trucks while one of us took turns watching with flashlight and gun. A few minutes later we were packed and headed down the mountain to the main rd. We did not see or hear anything while packing or leaving. When we got to the road, we stopped to unload our guns and stow them legally in the trucks. There was one house close to the road and after a while the dogs started to bark. I joked to JG that \\\"they\\\" were coming after us. Just then, we heard another set of howls about a mile back the rd. we'd just come down. Whatever it was had followed us and we left immediately. We were not sure what it was that night but after talking about the incident quite a bit, we think we had a Bigfoot encounter. It was a remote, wooded, mountain location with a large lake over the hill. There were at least three intelligent beings communicating that sounded loud and large. We had been leaving our scent all around and had been cooking meat all day. No person would be crazy enough to risk getting shot playing a prank on us. The howls were very eerie. Like I said, they were all like the first 2-tones of a wolf howl but much deeper. There was no trailing off like a dog/coyote/wolf howl, just 2-tones. Each 2-tone howl was in a series of three howls that took approx. 5-6 seconds per series. The only thing missing from the encounter was the lack of the famous Bigfoot stench. There was no wind so maybe the thing in the treeline was far enough away for it not to reach us. We are not out to hoax anyone. We hope none of our colleagues find out so our day to day judgment is not questioned or ridiculed. This was the first time any of us had seen any of the other ones scared. We just felt that we had to share our experience for what its worth.\", \"location_details\": \"The encounter took place above Beaver Meadow Spring in the San Juan National Forest east of Vallecito Reservoir.

The creature was traveling South to North. He stated that he was traveling about 30mph. Mr. E.H. also stated that the creature was brownish-red in color, no facial features were noted as the creature never looked in his direction.The head appeared to look like a humans. The creature crossed the road in about 3-4 steps, and was very fast. He said that the creature looked to be hunched over. The arms were swinging in a pumping like fashion, like a sprinters arms would pump. Mr. E.H. stopped at the area the creature crossed and looked around, no smell or odor was noted, and no tracks were found due to the hardness of the road and ground. Nothing else was noted.

The creature in this sighting was also a brownish color and was seen crossing a pipeline.This is in the same area as the 2nd sighting. This area appears to be an active area. Unknown vocalizations also occur at this area. Mr. E.H. has lived and hunted in this area for 40+ yrs and has never heard the vocalizations being heard before.

We were on 4-wheelers traveling to an area near a previous sighting by a family member. We came to a large puddle in the 4-wheeler trail and were trying to negotiate around it when he asked me to come look at something. What I found was a 12\\\" track that was no more then a few days old. The track had some wear due to the rain from Sunday night through Monday late afternoon. We were approximately 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile into the woods. I sent his son to get my plaster box from the back of my truck as I had no where to carry it in. After looking around I found another track about 10 yards from the other but in a very wet and flooding area. I photographed this track as it was impossible to cast. No other tracks were found. After his son returned I measured the track and found it to be 12\\\" inches in length, and was 3/4 to 1 inch into the ground. Mr.E.H. tried to make a track in the ground nearby but was unsuccessful ( he weighes over 200Lbs). It was unclear how many toes were present due to the mud and leaves in the track. Several photos were made of the track before plaster was poured into it. Due to prior obligations I was forced to leave the cast till Friday 4-7 when I could return. Mr. E.H. and myself secured the area as best we could. I returned on Friday around 10:30 am with my brother Shane.The 2 of us along with Mr.E.H. returned to the spot to retrieve the track cast. We retrieved the cast with no problems. We looked around the area and found what appeared to be Pine saplings that had been bitten and picked at to retrieve termites that were in the trees. We found approx. 8 -10 of these ranging from 3ft to 7ft off the ground. We also found a tree about 3 inches in diameter that had been twisted at the base and broke over. Photos were taken of these.

It was late June and I was on a fishing trip to several lakes and beaver ponds in the area.  I was supposed to be taking a friend along, but he had to cancel at the last minute. I left my camp at Dumont Lake in the morning and headed up the four wheel drive road to the trailhead that leads to Fish Hook Lake and Lost Lake. It is usually possible to drive the three miles to the trailhead, but the road was closed by the Forest Service due to lingering snow drifts, so I had to hike the road. I arrived at Fishook Lake in the late morning and spent a couple of hours fishing and eating lunch.  About 1:30 I left that lake and began to hike to Lost Lake which is only a few hundred yards to the northeast. The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake, and as the lake came into view I noticed a large, dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder.  My first thought was that I had suprised a bear, so I froze and waited to see what the animal would do.  It was soon obvious that this animal was not a bear or any other animal I had ever seen.  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched, it appeared to be staring across the lake.  When it saw me, it fully crouched next to the boulder with its left hand resting on the rock. What I saw is best described as a large, hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape. The animal was covered with shiny, dark hair that was approximately 3-4\\\" long and was somewhat shorter in the face area.  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person's.  The head was somewhat dome-shaped and was set on massive shoulders, the neck appeared very short.  The animal's eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge.  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide.  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin. I never saw the animal open its mouth or display teeth. After the animal crouched, it again looked over the lake then back at me.  The animal then stood up and to my relief pivoted away from me and began to walk away from me at an angle.  I moved forward to get a better look and the animal must have heard me move because it began to move quicker and glanced back at me.  The animal walked briskly into the trees and I heard it moving for a couple more seconds then it was out of earshot.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 12 seconds. I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend, but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth, I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado.  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities, but I was alone and the animal was big, I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds, so I left and hiked quickly out of the area, not slowing down until I got to my truck. After getting back to camp, I debated about what to do and finally decided the potential ridicule if I reported this to someone and the animal was not found was not worth it.  I watched the media for any unusual reports of bigfoot-type animals in Colorado in the months and years after my sighting and a few reports did indeed trickle in.  I got on the internet to further research the subject and eventually spoke with a BFRO researcher about my encounter and he urged me to submit a report.\", \"location_details\": \"Lost Lake, just north of Rabbit Ears Pass, in the Routt National Forest.\", \"county\": \"Jackson County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 3664: Daytime sighting on the edge of Lost Lake, near the Continental Divide\", \"latitude\": 40.4521, \"longitude\": -106.6535, \"date\": \"1996-06-26T00:00:00\", \"number\": 3664.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9xhnjh1693\", \"temperature_high\": 72.28, \"temperature_mid\": 57.8, \"temperature_low\": 43.32, \"dew_point\": 39.39, \"humidity\": 0.58, \"cloud_cover\": 0.42, \"moon_phase\": 0.34, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 9.75, \"wind_bearing\": 137.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.83, \"location\": \"POINT(-106.6535 40.4521)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My experience with Bigfoot occured when I was about ten years old during the fall of 1977.

At the fork in the trail, running north and east, was a small sand pit which I crouched into because I saw someone or something in the distance.  I peered over the rough, looking slightly northeastward. I watched this thing for nearly five minutes.  It was over 7 feet tall and weighted about 500 - 700 pounds from as far as I could tell.  It was black from head to toe.  Even its face was black.  It was tearing off tree limbs and pushing over rotted trees.   Playing as such as I had done several days earlier at the exact same spot. It must have been watching me.  It amazed me because there were really no rotted trees left to push over or rotted tree branches to break. It's strength was incredible.

They were staying in a Log Cabin with one of the family members, and had spent the first few days of thier trip walking the outlying forestry, and going to old mining sites and other places of interest. On the fourth day, they all decided to spend an evening out with a barbeque and invited over a few friends from a travelling show that they know from Iowa. At dusk, my aunt said that two of the travellers (J & S) returned to the barbecue, after hiking up a small valley for about 5 miles. Both were visibly shaken and upset. They told everyone that they had been followed by something at a distance of 30 ft or so for the past few hours, it smelled similar to old, damp caravan interiors and when J had shouted towards the creature, it seemed to back off slightly before violently shaking foliage. This is when they both panicked - as J could see 'fur' as the creature moved, and thought it could've been a bear. My aunt requested that everyone leave just in case the 'bear' had followed J & S back to camp, but due to inebriation most of the group were laughing, and didn't take the story too seriously. At about 10:00pm, a fire was lit, and some of the travellers started juggling firesticks or playing thier instruments. My aunt thinks this may have been a lure, as over the festivities they heard a very loud, very high pitched scream just off the small clearing. One of the more drunken members of the group started walking and shouting towards where the vocalization had eminated - he later stated that he was 'trying to communicate' - when a few of the people at close range saw what was described as 'a very tall, very powerful ape-like creature' moving at first into the clearing, and then away from the camp at great speed. It had long beige hair, approx 6\\\" long, and a dark area around the face and elbows. Everyone left the scene quickly and in panic - J left his very expensive juggling batons and a few other important belongings, so it is clear that they didn't want to stick around. No-one wanted to return the next day to the site, and one of our relatives waited a week before going to look for lost property. Unfortunately, new fires had been lit suggesting that campers had been in the vicinity since, and no belongings or tracks could be found.\", \"location_details\": \"Outside of Fairplay, in dense forestry at a clearing often used by caravans and campers.\", \"county\": \"Park County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 3112: UK Gypsies vacate Colorado campsite after encounter with 7' creature\", \"latitude\": 39.20834, \"longitude\": -106.0417, \"date\": \"2001-09-30T00:00:00\", \"number\": 3112.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9wux4cwv1k\", \"temperature_high\": 59.79, \"temperature_mid\": 46.6, \"temperature_low\": 33.41, \"dew_point\": 28.27, \"humidity\": 0.58, \"cloud_cover\": 0.38, \"moon_phase\": 0.44, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1023.01, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 139.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.35, \"location\": \"POINT(-106.0417 39.20834)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was coming home from hunting and I looked down the side of a field.

We pulled off of I-25 Southbound into the gas station parking lot.  When we were driving down the frontage road towards the gas station, we saw a few vehicles on the far end of the parking lot with 3-4 people talking and a NM State Police cruiser was leaving the lot, however, upon parking in front of the gas station, we discovered that it was closed.  I needed to pee rather urgently, so I ran around to the back of the station to find a dark place to do my business.  I walked about 15-20 meters behind the gas station to be out of sight of the occupied vehicles in the gas station lot.  As I was urinating I began to feel...uncomfortable.  I was peeing in open ground and initially thought somebody was walking up behind me (probably to do the same thing).  I craned a looked around and saw nobody and no animals; just a blanket feeling that somebody was very near me.  As I finished peeing, I turned and began briskly walking back towards our vehicle.  As I was hurrying back I turned to look behind me; and that is when I became a believer. Before I continue, I would like to preface my anecdote by alluding to my high-level of academic credentialing alongside my occupation as a healthcare executive.  I also provide executive and technical advise to elected and appointed officials; I have worked very hard to become an expert based on empirical analysis and studied fact.  I did not believe in Bigfoot, ghosts or another unexplained anomalies.  I believed in results, hard work and, well, results.  My perspective is now very different. As I turned and looked over my left shoulder, I saw an enormous, lurking animal.  The animal was crouched over, almost as if taking cover in the sparse and cold vegetation.  In fact, I think the creature watched me the whole time, and did not make so much as a noise.  However, the creature noticed when I saw it.  The creature stood up, and quickly lumbered into the dark away from the direction of the parking lot.  The one attribute of the creature that resounded with me was how heavy the footfall was.  It sounded like somebody dropping a sack of potatoes over and over again.  And it was fast.  I observed the creature for about 8-11 seconds, from the moment it realized I saw it, to watching the animal dart into the wood line.  Due to radiant light from the parking lot, I could make steady detail of the fleeing creature.  Here are the salient points from my memory (aside form the footfall): 1) The creature was approximately 8-10 feet tall.  I am 6\\\"2 and this animal would have towered over me ( I observed it on flat land lending to my estimation). 2) The hair on the creature was matted, like dogs that live outside.  The coloration was dark brown. 3)  The creature had a defined gait.  It took strides that I would estimate to be 3-4 of my strides per 1 of it's strides. 4)  The creature had massive, human like hands. 5) The creature was very skittish, not moving until realizing I was observing it, lending to a higher intellect that a brown bear.  I believe the creature may have even fled in fear. 6)  I did not make eye contact, but noticed a massive brown and defined jaw and cranial structure. There is one other trait that I have since read about that may allude to this being a New Mexico Bigfoot.  The air was rank with what I thought was the dumpster behind the gas station.  However, this may be the \\\"musk\\\" eyewitnesses have reported in the past.  I cannot be sure, but it was very powerful, and somewhat reminiscent of what I perceived to be urine. This incident was fearful and moving.  I was unable to sleep for days and could not even bring myself to tell my wife until recently.  Due to my profession and reputation, I have extreme, extreme reluctance about openly sharing my encounter.  However, I have personal visual evidence of a so-called mythical beast, and I do not know what to do with it. Another fact: I have a concealed carry handgun license in the State of New Mexico and was carrying a 1911 .45 at the time of incident.  I was so scared that reaching for my weapon would have been an afterthought.

He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear. The next night, my other daughter and I were upstairs getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m again and had the windows open. I heard the same sound again out my bedroom window. I quickly turned out the lights, and my daughter crawled from her room to mine to see if she could also hear it. By then, the sound had stopped. Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet. They heard this loud guttural sound also very close to the same place I had heard it originally and rolled under the garage door as fast as possible. Since that time, several of my family have had some very scary encounters with this sound near their houses. We live in a very wooded cedar and hardwood area with a year round creek. I would like to relate all of these incidents, but they are fairly numerous. I would be glad to tell you, and introduce you to the ones who have had these various experiences. These creatures have lived in this area for many years. My youngest son who is in college now, was out hunting with his friend. They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it. They both turned and left the woods very quickly.\", \"location_details\": \"[Details removed by witness request]\", \"county\": \"Franklin County\", \"state\": \"Missouri\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 20677: Resident describes possible vocalizations near Robertsville.\", \"latitude\": 38.40685, \"longitude\": -90.7, \"date\": \"2002-10-09T00:00:00\", \"number\": 20677.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9yzd2pf20g\", \"temperature_high\": 68.11, \"temperature_mid\": 58.865, \"temperature_low\": 49.62, \"dew_point\": 50.09, \"humidity\": 0.73, \"cloud_cover\": 0.45, \"moon_phase\": 0.12, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1020.06, \"summary\": \"Overcast in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 9.96, \"wind_bearing\": 183.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.73, \"location\": \"POINT(-90.7 38.40685)\"}, {\"observed\": \"A friend and I were going fishing after school.

It paused for a moment when it saw us and then it quickly moved away. I wouldn't say it ran but it moved much quicker then it did before it saw us. We just looked at each other and said what the hell is that? My friend wanted to run back down the path to the lake. I wanted to run after it. I had to keep saying let's go see what it is before he would follow me to the point it crossed our path. This took about 10 seconds. My friend followed behind me to the point where we saw it. We could see about 100 yards in the direction it went and we couldn't see it at all. I looked all around for tracks and didn't see anything other then rub marks. We didn't smell anything strange but the swamp area down there smells bad anyway. We didn't go fishing that day and just went back home. I was a little scared at first but I got really scared walking back home. On the walk back home we discussed what we saw. We knew no one would take us serious and believe us. We were just kids and we thought we would just get in trouble. We promised each other that we wouldn't tell anyone what we saw. It was over 6 feet tall but it wasn't over 7 feet. It was dark brown to black. At first I thought it was a big black guy in a fur coat until it turned slightly and looked at me. Then I knew it wasn't a bear or a man.

We were on our yearly deer-hunting trip in the remote mountainous area of Randolph County. I was about 24 years old and was in on leave from the military on the family-hunting trip. My family and friends have hunted this area for many years and I was very comfortable and familiar with the area. The road back had not been traveled for years and was very washed out and overgrows with brush. It was about 7-8 miles back before we came to the impassable areas of the road and it was then that we geared up and proceeded on foot. I would estimate we had gone about another 2-3 miles on foot before we reached the crest of the mountain and decided to find our hunting spots. The light had just begun to peek over the mountaintop when I cleared my spot and settled in. I had worked up a pretty good sweat on the steady pace up the mountain so it was not too long after setting and listening to the first morning light waking up the rest of the forest, I began to nod off to sleep. After going in and out a few times I decided to get up and move around a little to try to wake myself up. After about 20 minutes of walking around I stumbled on a very old wooden tree stand. Although I could tell it had been there for many years, I remember thinking it was in the best spot overlooking the very visible and open woods just under the crest of the hilltop. Not too long after I ate the apples and oranges I had brought. After a while the warm morning sun took its toll on me and I nodded off again. A bad smell woke me right up. The forest was completely quiet around me and all I could think of is what the hell that awful smell is? As I became more alert, I could hear the slight rustling below me and what I thought was some faint grunts and whines. I decided it was time to lean over and get a visual on it. It was about 25 feet below me on the slope and directly in front of the stand. It was not aware of my presence above it. It was about 5 feet tall with long dark, reddish-brown hair. The hair from its head down its body was of equal length, about 2-3 inches long. The hair went down its arms and hands as well as its feet. I could barley see fingernails and toe nails. Not claws but nails like a human. Most of its hair was tangled and matted in spots as if it had wallowed the ground or a tree or something. I watched it smelling the orange peels and apple core then tasting them. It looked around at one point as if to wonder where they may have come from. I wondered how long it would be before it became aware of my presence and what it would do when it did. Then I heard the rustling coming down from the top of the hill, loud rustling, and I could tell something was coming at a pretty rapid speed. I saw the one below me turn and look in the direction of the noise. It froze for a few seconds and looked almost like a statue. I could not see at this point what was coming down the hill. I was leaning to my right and looking down. I tried to move my eyes to the left but my view was blocked by the trees that was holding up my stand and partially by the full-brim hat I was wearing. I kept my eyes moving between the one below me and the direction of the disturbance coming down the hill. As it moved toward our position it began to make noises like I have never heard before. I would ordinarily not be able to describe the noise but I have read where other people have described it as a record being played backward. I would have to say that is a very close description. It is as if it were speaking a language but nothing like I have ever heard before. The one below me sprang to its feet and then moved about 15-20 feet to the right of me. It moved very rapidly, kind of between a run and a leap, all on its feet though. It did not use its arms. It then started to bellow back at the one coming down the hill and it sounded almost like they were arguing. That is the impression that it left me with anyway. It wasn't until the one above me came into clear view that I started to feeling very scared. As it came into my immediate area it moved toward the first one and began to slow to what seemed to be very cautious movements. Its attention seemed to move between the first creature and its surrounding area. I felt at this moment that it was alert to my presence. This second one was much larger than the first and it seemed very irritated. The bigger one was covered in very dark hair, almost black. It was very muscular and its arms were noticeably long. It stood with a slight bend but an upright posture. I had to be about 8-9 feet tall. It was much larger than a human. As these two creatures squabbled (communicated?) back and forth their gestures were extremely human-like. I was under the impression that the larger of the two was scolding the smaller one. They moved about 40-50 feet to the right of me. At this point the larger one had its back to me I could make out facial features of the smaller one. It had very human-like features but a different nose. Hair covered most of its face but it looked to be thin hair, not like the rest of it. Then the smaller creature spotted me because it went into a crouched and then squatting position and looked up in my direction. Their chattering began to quiet and then the larger one, with its back still to me, went into a squatting position for a few seconds. The smaller one then began to howl and bellow very loudly. The larger of the one, with its back still toward me began to howl very loud also. The larger creature then pushed the smaller one and the smaller one sprang to its feet and rapidly ran off across the hill to my right. It ran in long leaping strides and moved very fast like nothing I had ever seen. I never noticed it to ever look back. As the smaller one ran the larger one stood up and slowly turned toward me. It had its arm bent above its forehead as if it were shading or hiding its eyes. It stood very straight and tall and looked directly at my tree stand. All of the fear from before overcame me again and I prayed that thing did not try to come up my tree. I thought for an instant that I would yell at it, jerk or jump and maybe frighten it away but I could not bring myself to move. I could not even bat an eye. I could feel my legs starting to shake and I became very hot all over. For an instant I though I was going to pass out or become physically ill. For a brief moment it was looking right at my face. From what I could see it had very large human-like eyes and very large round nostrils. I could not make out lips because of the hair on its face but I would guess that they were thin lips because the hair did not stick out. It did not have much of a protruding mouth or jaw like an ape. It had a flat fairly face like a human. It put its arm to its side and began to look around. It swiveled at the hips and looked in every direction. After a quick glance back at me it then began to walk off in the direction the smaller one had gone. It did not run or act scared at all. It made very long howls as it walked and turned a few times and looked in my direction as it walked away. I watched it and listened until it became just a black figure moving through the woods. I could here it howl and bellow for a few more minutes. Then I heard what sounded like something beating a tree or log with a limb or stick or something. After about 30 minutes I decided that if it meant to do me harm, it sure had the chance, and it was probably safe to get down out of the tree stand. I made my way back toward my friend that I had left earlier that morning. I never even thought to check the ground for evidence or anything. After about an hour I walked up on my friend and could see his blaze orange through the trees. I very carefully made my way in his direction. As I approached him I could see that he was staring at me. He was sitting against some downed trees and he did not move a muscle. As I walked closer to him I smiled and asked him if he had seen anything. He was very pale and I could tell he was a little scared and puzzled and then he answered to me the he was not sure what he had saw. I jokingly said, \\u201cYou look like you saw a Bigfoot!\\u201d and he jumped to his feet and asked, \\u201cDid you see it?\\u201d I nodded to him, yes, then he began to tell me what he saw. Apparently the larger creature had moved across the hill in front of him crashing through the trees about 40 to 50 yards away. He said at first he thought it was a bear but after observing it, he could plainly see that it was moving very fast and walking up right, like a man. I said we should try to track the two creatures but it really didn\\u2019t take too much for him to talk me out of it.

I [have] lived in Washington my whole life and spent a lot time in the woods with my father. He moved here from Tennessee and was excited to see the wilderness of Washington. We spent a lot of time around the North Fork of the Skykomish that day.

My Aunt, my cousin and myself were out in the woods behind my Grandmas house.  We had been working on building a cabin all summer, just for fun.  We would often pack a picnic lunch and spend the day out in the woods.  I heard a noise, like snapping twigs, I turned around and saw in the distance a glimpse of a figure running that appeared light brown in color.  I first thought that it was one of my other cousins coming back to help and then dismissed it from my mind and continued on with the work.  Later that day when we went back up to Grandma's house I then discovered that it could not have been my other cousin, because he had a blue shirt on, not a light brown one. The following weekend, my Aunt, two of my cousins and myself were working on the cabin, we ate lunch and then my cousins and I walked up the trail and down an incline to play on the huge grapevines that we like to climb on. I looked up and saw a hairy brown man like creature sitting up against the fence post.  He was sitting on his behind with his legs bent up and his arms were wrapped around his legs.  He was just looking at us.  I screamed, my cousin looked over and we ran with my other cousin who is younger than us, she did not see what we saw.  I looked back once and the creature was standing in an upright position. I'm not sure if he ran after us or not, I was too scared to look back. To this day the cabin is not finished.

I decided to go for a walk in the woods because I was bored and was thinking about shooting my rifle a bit. Nothing special, just what I normally did as a youth (since I'm not much of a people person I spent a lot of my youth in the woods). I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away. As I got halfway up the hill, I was suddenly shocked by a very loud whistle that was quickly followed by a scream that I had heard many times before as a kid. I knew from previous experience that I didn't want to hang around even though I was \\\"armed to the teeth\\\". I was 19 going on 20 at the time and I've spent the majority of my youth spending time alone in the woods, hunted almost everything in the area that could be legally hunted, so I know what the normal sounds of the woods are, and no, it wasn't a swine, bear , coon, or any other such creature. The scream I heard instantly filled me with fear even though I had an 8mm Hakim Mauser, 12 ga. shotgun, and a 22 cal. pistol. I always went hunting heavily armed because I have stumbled across sasquatch a few times before and decided that next time I'd be more prepared. I was about halfway up the hill when I heard the scream a few ridges over (1/2-3/4mi away from me). I quickly turned and decided to call it a night, as I was walking down the hill, I heard another scream at the top of the hill I was walking down (either they can run like hell or there were two). Before I got to the bottom of the hill, I then decided that although I had a lot of weapons and ammo, this wasn't anything that I wanted to shoot alone at night with only a maglite taped to my barrel. I figured running for the road would take too long and a more direct route would be better, so I cut across the field and jumped the creek behind my house. I guess I didn't notice till after I had crossed the creek, but it had followed me home (which wasn't far, maybe a few hundred yards). I can tell you that to keep up with a terrified 20yr old running faster than ever before, that thing had to be extremely fast. I stood by the back porch and could hear its heavy breathing and growling. It sounded kinda like a horse that had just run till it was winded, but the breathing wasn't labored. It was breathing in a normal rhythmic tone, not labored. I was terrified because even after firing a few rounds in it's direction I could still \\\"feel\\\" it's presence and hear it, so I unloaded in that direction. I fired over 100 shells thru the Hakim, a full box of shells from the 12ga. and every shell I had for my 22 before I ran in the house to grab more ammo and turn some more lights on. I must've shot around 150 or more shells, I figured that I had shot at it enough and wanted to save what ammo I had left in case it decided to try to come in for a visit durring the night, so I went in the house and stayed awake all night. The next day(about noon) I decided to go see what I hit. When I crossed the creek I could plainly see where I had fired because of the holes in the trees and the saplings that were broken from bullets. Found no blood, no footprints(it was dry) but I did find something I didnt expect...it had laid down when I began shooting and must've been there for a while because there was a flattened area that looked like a deer bed. Although deer do frequent the area, I sincerely doubt it was deer, because there was no scat, and deer scat alot in and around their beds, as well as it was a good 1/4 mi. from the nearest deer trail. I'm an experinced woodsman, and I have never run across a creature that was smart enough to lay down and stay put while bullets were flying over it's head...animals just don't have the reasoning it would take to exert that type of behavior. Like I said, I never saw it, I just heard it and heard it's foot falls, it was absolutely two legged, it was huge, and I don't think it wanted to say hello. Not sure what it wanted, but it was definately very intelligent. That was the only event of this nature during the time I lived there(6yrs.)...oh yeah, I don't remember smelling it's body funk till after I had started shooting, maybe it wasn't close enough for me to smell it or I was just to scared, either way, I hope this info helps your investigation.\", \"location_details\": \"Do ya one better, here's a satellite photo of the place where it happened http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/image.aspx?Lon=-89.23263719&Lat=37.11832531&w=1&ref=G|-89.23263719,37.11832531.

First, I would like to qualify myself as a competent woodsman...certainly no 19th century mountain man, but one who knows his way around the outdoors.  I was camping in the Rio Grande National Forest in Conejos County Colorado in September of 2005.  For those famaliar with this geographical area, I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as 'Jacob's Hill.'  I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.  It was a very throaty sound and could best be described as an animal in agony.  While I have never heard a mountain lion roar in person I have heard this and other \\\"cat\\\" noises on T.V. and this did not sound at all like those noises.  The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing. Now, fast forward 2 months into November in camp in the same location for the elk hunting season. Bear in mind that until this moment in November I had not mentioned this incident to anyone.  I awoke at 4 AM one cold morning and noticed that someone else was awake and had built our camp fire again.  Because I was going to get up in another hour or so anyway, I got up and stepped outside.  It was my brother prowling around and I asked why he was up so early.  He replied that he had gotten up to go to the bathroom and the weirdest thing had happened.  I interrupted him immediately and told that before he told me what had happened I wanted to tell him about my experience.  I related to him the very story I told above.  When I was finished my brother just looked at me in amazement and said that is exactly what he had just experienced verbatim; right down to the coyotes reacting.  He, like me, could not relate the sound to anything we had ever seen or heard.\", \"location_details\": \"[GPS coordinates were supplied, and are shown in the internal database, but have been removed by the Editor from the public version of the report.]\", \"county\": \"Conejos County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 19804: Hunter reports unusual roars In South San Juan Mountains\", \"latitude\": 37.3199, \"longitude\": -106.3325, \"date\": \"2005-09-20T00:00:00\", \"number\": 19804.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9wskk3gh1j\", \"temperature_high\": 66.13, \"temperature_mid\": 56.935, \"temperature_low\": 47.74, \"dew_point\": 25.0, \"humidity\": 0.32, \"cloud_cover\": 0.06, \"moon_phase\": 0.6, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1026.01, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 8.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 240.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.42, \"location\": \"POINT(-106.3325 37.3199)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I am writing this report on behalf of my girlfriend.

I was about ready to call it a night when I heard distinct footsteps coming towards me.

I thought it was on the trail I had came in on but realized it was up on the side of the hill. I got closer and it stepped on a couple of limbs that cracked from its weight.

Our neighborhood borders a series of orange, grapefruit and tangerine groves that are all adjacent to landfill and mining property.  Around 7:30 pm my daughter asked, as she does typically, \\\"dad, lets go look at the pigs\\\". About three to four times a week we ride these groves on our four wheeler and survey for wild animals. We've seen bobcat, coyote and pigs. In the past two and a half months we have been following a family of pigs which when we first sighted them had around 15 piglets about a month old. So we have been spotting them to see the growth of the piglets who are about 40 lbs now. After making our normal rounds around a few sections of groves we had not spotted the family. After riding slot down one of the main grove roads she spotted a big boar and we kept moving. The four wheeler was giving us some problems so I ran up through the gears to maybe clean the carb a little which put us about a quarter of a mile down this main road further back into the groves. We then turned around and returned to the spot where she had seen the big boar, well a few rows of trees short, where we slowed our pace to view this pig. Sure enough he was there. Three rows of trees past this location was the intersection of another heavily traveled grove road where we slowed down and turned the four wheeler off to listen for any more pigs. Just after shutting the four wheeler off a smaller boar crossed the adjacent main road....and then another, another and another. Three boars crossed. Immediately after seeing the boars, in the opposite direction we both heard four simultaneous noises. Now I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, hunting small and large game and also fishing for the last 25 years. I've seen and heard just about every animal in the local ecosystem and still hunt alligators yearly. After hearing these noises my immediate thought was...\\\"what are people doing out here\\\", when my daughter asked what was that dad? If you've ever heard a panther cry in the wild, than that was the closest animal sound I could explain to my daughter that we might have heard. Immediately after telling her that I heard her take a quick deep breath and quickly looked in the direction she was when I saw what I cannot describe as any animal I have seen in 25 years. I saw something dark brown, upright and moving very quickly across the row between the trees. My daughter asks \\\" dad, what was that\\\" when I replied \\\"I don't know\\\". I kill 10 to 13ft alligators for sport and am not easily frightened. This animal made the hair on my arms stand on end and chills run down my body. After studdering in my nervousness, we finally got the four wheeler started and sped off to our house. On the ride home, after i had in my own mind dismissed all other possible animals, told my daughter that I believe what we saw was a Sasquatch. The next day after work my dad, daughter and I went back to the location to look for hair, footprints or any other signs of the animal with no results. The sand was too soft to even make out the pig tracks. I did however stand with my daughter and have my dad walk to where we saw this animal and do a size comparison. We estimated it to be between 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Pigs and other 4 legged animals are low and long so I know for sure that's not what this was. So after hearing these sounds and seeing what we saw, the only animal that I can compare to it was a Sasquatch.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Polk County\", \"state\": \"Florida\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 41265: Possible sighitng at dusk by father and daughter riding an ATV near Bartow\", \"latitude\": 27.93531, \"longitude\": -81.87347, \"date\": \"2013-05-16T00:00:00\", \"number\": 41265.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dhvybvmwcz\", \"temperature_high\": 86.57, \"temperature_mid\": 74.57499999999999, \"temperature_low\": 62.58, \"dew_point\": 60.24, \"humidity\": 0.64, \"cloud_cover\": 0.06, \"moon_phase\": 0.21, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1019.33, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 9.0, \"visibility\": 9.95, \"wind_bearing\": 127.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.32, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.87347 27.935309999999998)\"}, {\"observed\": \"The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town.

I made the relatively short hike down the old road bed to my spot by the river.I dropped my pack against a tree and went down the step embankment to the rivers edge to check out the water and soak up some sunshine to warm up.After a few minutes I heard what I thought was another fisherman or someone up above me where the old foundation was.I thought \\\"great,so much for peace and quiet, must be hardcore trout fisherman like me to be here in cold weather\\\". I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people,, what I saw in broad day light, probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla, except his face didn't protrude out,it was flatter,and the hair was the color of a squirrel, browns, black, silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there, head slightly tilted back, squinting his eyes,soaking up the sunshine, just as I was.I couldn't comprehend what I was looking at at first. My first thought was \\\"what am I looking at?\\\".. Second thought was\\\" God,look how big he is\\\". It was incredibly muscular, at least 4ft wide at shoulders, 7-8ft in height,massive animal. The skin was a dark grayish color around the face, head was extremely pointed, like a dunce hat almost, no neck,large pectorals visible under the hair. Eye color was like a shade of amber. It was squinting in the bright sun, soaking up some warmth. He didn't really see me at first I don't think.I did kinda pop up over the embankment, I think he knew I was there but didn't really know where .He could have been trying to smell me. I watched this massive beautiful animal standing there in the bright sun for probably 15-20 seconds.I had a feeling of amazement, wonder & actually privileged .I knew that what I was looking at was truly one of Gods immaculate creations. It was beautiful, big and scary as hell, but beautiful. Hair was clean, looked groomed almost. Very healthy animal. After 15-20 seconds of seeing this I actually stepped up over the embankment all the way in view and I said out loud something like \\\"hey big boy,ain't you a pretty thing!\\\" That's when it finally saw me. It dropped its head down & froze. I could tell I surprised it. It wouldn't make eye contact. I could see its whole posture change. It became very shy& acted like it was hoping that as long as it didn't look directly at me I wouldn't see him. It was like a bashful child.I took a few steps toward it and said \\\"hey big boy\\\" ,or something to that effect, and that was enough for him. He turned to his left and he was out of there. I could here the limbs & leaves rustling as he made his getaway. He moved like a deer going up the mountain, fast fast. Didn't see him but I could hear him. After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent. Then I clearly hear what sounded like someone doing a drum roll with wooden sticks on a wooden table. Three\\\" brat-tat-tat-tat's,very quick, very clear, definitely not a woodpecker. No doubt in my mind it was him. He had traversed the mountain side and was on the ridgeline above me in no more than 5-10 seconds. Unbelievable. I never felt threatened, never felt afraid. Was a feeling of privilege & respect. I set up camp and stayed at that spot for the night and all the next day but never saw it again.

Actually in Fresno. The area is mostly farm land and some sparse woods and vineyards. nothing like foresty though. My self, my cousin and a friend had decided to go late night fishing at a little area on the river where the river sort of pools. Their is a bridge there. It was late and we were sitting there and fishing when we heard something making noise and looked back and saw a coyote running across the bridge heading north. The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd. We then heard what we thought was a splash as if someone had dove into the water behind us. It was dark so we just glanced back but of course saw nothing. We probably sat for about 10 minutes or so when suddenly there was a huge goosh and splash about 25 yards away in front of us. We stopped fishing and then tried looking into the darkness.This small boulder throwing continued at least 2 more times before we actually saw a dark figure about 40 yards away standing what looked about waist high in the river. Their was a full moon so it wasn't to dark to see that it was a pretty big creature. By this time we were starting to get scared and were pretty much froze in place and had began to yell at it, thinking that it could be a person. This prompted my friend to yell threats of violence as young people are sometime prone to do, this creature basically turned it's whole body to the right of it and grapped another boulder and with both hands over its head it threw it at us, this one landed about 15 yards away. It made no sound or noise only threw small boulders. It threw about 2 more boulders the last landing about 5 yards from us enough to splash water on our faces. By this time we had reeled in our lines and were trying to get out of there as fast as we could. We ran all the way back to the car which was through some trees across a field and up a hill. We went back the next day to the area and on rafts floated to the area where the creature had stood. My friend is about 6 foot tall and jumped in the water to see about how deep it was. The water came to his shoulders. Their was no way this was a man. We even saw some of the boulders that had been thrown at the bottom of the water as it wasn't more then 5 1/2 feet deep.

There were four of us, my two sons and their friend. We hunted for about four hours and my youngest and I decided to go back to camp and drive around and pick up the other kids. I left my guns with the two boys and went back with my youngest to camp he carried a 30-30 winchester. The walk back to camp was uneventful. We could see where the boys were but couldn't get to them by car so we radioded them to go back to camp. I forgot to tell you that we had three radios. I carry one and each of the boys carry one. We then heard what we thouth were elk coming up the cliff. We sat and listened for a while and then went to investigate. On the way to the area of the noise I noticed a tall dark tree trunk in the bushes, but keept going to the area that we thought the noise came from. We looked around and found no evidence of elk and decided to go back to the car. On the return trip I notice the tree trunk looked odd so I asked my son for his 30-30 winchester. I looked at the \\\"tree trunk\\\" and the hair on the back of my neck stood up, I was about 25 yards from it and it looked like it had eyes and they moved. My son said to come on back because he had seen it earlier and said it was just a tree. We went back to the car and he imediately locked the car door and told me to get the hell out of there. He had told me that it was a tree because if the bigfoot killed me he would be next. Yes he said he saw it move and when it's eyes moved he said he almost went bananas. It was almost black with alot of gray hair. It was about 6-7 feet tall no neck very wide. I'm going back in the spring just make sur it really wasn't a tree.

I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. I\\u2019m an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadn\\u2019t been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day. I had first been intrigued by the idea of Sasquatch when I found some info online while searching for hiking sites. As a kid some local friends had told me stories, but I\\u2019d never been sure what to make of it. I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote. I wasn\\u2019t totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare. I arrived at the campground at about one o\\u2019clock. An older couple was there reading, enjoying the campground. I picked an area and began set up my tent. As I was pounding the stakes in I felt something hit the ground behind me. I turned around and I didn\\u2019t see anything. I looked over at the couple and they were still sitting at their campsite. Whatever it was had caused a very strong vibration in the ground behind me and it couldn\\u2019t have been anyone at the camp. A little bit later I started to hear a weird noise. At first I thought it was the antifreeze bubbling in my car because it was a hot day and my car was steaming a little. My car overheats a lot. The sounds were like a low rumbling growl. It was a sustained sound that lasted for just a couple seconds. However I seemed to hear it in regular intervals. The sound also seemed to kind of echo like the sound of something hollow or the sound of water down a drain which is why at the time I thought it was my car. I decided to explore the area; I walked by the two other campers and said hi. They had a poodle that barked at me little. I wanted to see if I could look over Tiger Canyon at the valley from where we were so I crossed over to the other side if Kendall Skyline Road. I couldn\\u2019t see much through all the trees so I decided to head the other way. I brought a GPS device with me that had topography maps loaded on it. It showed a trail into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness that I wanted to follow. As I started in that direction I noticed a very large track just to the right of a pool of water in some soft mud. It didn\\u2019t really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin. I told myself it couldn\\u2019t be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it. I came back and looked around the area behind the camp where I had felt the thump. I had heard something knocking on a tree so I tried to make noise like I had done when I was hammering the tent posts. I had a little pattern of sorts that I thumped onto the ground with a rock. It seemed like at one point whatever it was mimicked the pattern of my thumps. I explored the area I thought it was coming from, but only saw a deer, so I figured maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me. The noises stopped and I felt relieved. \\u201cIt was all just in my head\\u201d I thought. It was now somewhere between 1:30 pm and 2 pm, and I started down towards Squaw Spring. I noticed some more prints as I walked but I still didn\\u2019t believe what I was seeing. I found some that seemed to continue on further but I did not follow them since I had planned to go a few miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and didn\\u2019t want to waste time. It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring. This all seemed too surreal to me because there were lots of prints everywhere even some that appeared smaller, possibly a juvenile animal, but they were just thin outlines. I had never seen prints like these in person so I was unsure what I was even looking at. I kept walking and came to a clearing on the side of a grade where I found a print that was about 3 inches deep and well defined. I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel. Suddenly I thought wow these prints are for real. I now had a feeling one of these creatures could be around any corner. I got to the top of one of the mountains to get a nice view of the wilderness area and then made my way back to camp. When I got back I was pretty tired from hiking. The two other people at the campground left in their pickup shortly after I got there and I went to relax in my tent. I was the only one at the campground now. About an hour later I heard the same low rumbling growl sound from earlier. I realized that my car had now been off for 3 or 4 hours, and there was really no way it could be the car. I was hearing more knocking and like I had earlier. It sounded like someone was smacking a branch against a tree. I realized whatever creature this was; it must be the same one that came by before because the knocking and the low growl started at the same time after being silent for so long. It sounded like it was in the same area behind my campsite where I had heard the thump earlier. It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark. Being there by myself made me very nervous, especially with the growling noise and tree knocking apparently being directed toward me and my campsite. I got out of there as fast as I could. I got back to town and felt very paranoid. I spent time walking downtown Walla Walla calming myself down and recounting the events. I had never been so scared of the outdoors. People noticed I looked visibly shaken though I had not mentioned the incident. It was hard to even tell anyone in fear of them thinking I was crazy.\", \"location_details\": \"I set up camp at Skyline Campground (formerly Squaw Springs Campground)It is along Kendall Skyline Road.

But, here goes, just the same; Around the first week in October of this year, I had decided to go out squirrel hunting since it was such a nice day. I went out to a piece of land we had previously owned and have retained hunting rights on it. I had just left my truck and headed down into the woods, checking out a large rock/over-hang formation when something moving to my right (southwest) about 175-200 feet away, caught my eye. I was looking thru rather thick brush, separated by a barbed wire fence, a  creek bed and lots of vegetation and thick brush. At first, all I could see was what looked like \\\"the biggest turkey I'd ever seen' flapping its wings in a very strange way. All I could make out was something that appeared to be a very large black turkey flapping its wings in a very strange, but fast manner. I moved around to the right a little bit to try and get a better look, when all of a sudden this thing gets up on two feet and starts running like a bat out of hell. It no more got up when suddenly another one, much larger and reddish brown in color jumped up behind it and in its attempt to catch up to the black one, appeared to almost fall forward, all the while moving very, very fast and disappearing just as quickly, but amazingly quietly thru some of the thickest brush we have down there. I think I was frozen stiff in disbelief, trying to gather what I had just seen. I stood there, dazed for about a minute and decided to cross the barbed wire fence and creek bed and go over to where I had seen \\\"them\\\" get up and run. Once I got over there, I found indentations in the soft grassy, almost marsh-like terrain, but no real discernable tracks. what is interesting is that what I thought I had seen as a turkey flapping it's wings,was probably the black animal sitting or kneeling, and reaching up for choke-cherries on the tree it was nearby. I followed their brief trail right up to where they silently entered the thick brush and decided not to go any further, thinking that if two creatures so huge could go thru that thick brush so quitely, how would I ever know they hadn't circled back and were watching me from behind? I got spooked at that thought and got out of there.

I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!

Recently my family relocated to land that we own -- upon which we are in the process of bulding a new house.  Despite the noise of nailguns, etc., as weird as it might appear, my wife claims that at approx 4:30pm CST, on the last Saturday of the year, 29th?, she went for a walk in the woods.  This was not an ordinary walk, because we live right at the edge of a forest/woods that surrounds a lake.  We are located  NW of Paris, Texas, in Lamar County.  Anyways, she went for this walk in the woods because it was her first walk of the season. We are affraid to go down into the woods during the summer, as it is snake infested.   So we usually wait until it freezes before we venture...   It was down around 30 to 40 degrees that day.  Our land is a pretty chunk of property.  It backs up within 1/2 mile of the lake.  We are the last owners on our road.  Uncle Sam is our neighbor.  I believe the land is part of the State of Texas' Wildlife Management land, and the Army Corp of Engineers, actually built and own the lake.  My friend is telling me now that the area adjoining this lake  is approx 19,000 acres +.  Anyways, thats the rough conditions here in Lamar County.  Heavily wooded and open pasture mix.  Lots of snakes.  Moderate climate. My wife walked approx. one hundred yards down to a creek below our property, stopped and sat on a natural log bridge, suspended over this small ten foot creek, which drains down to the lake, usually having a steady but small amount of water.  Lots of moss, dead trees, gnarly grapevines, etc., type-setting.  She claims that she was looking into the binoculars and saw a \\\"large monkey looking creature.\\\"  The funny thing was that she told me also that \\\"it couldn't have been a Bigfoot, cause' it was only about your size...\\\"  (I'm approx 6 foot4, and 240 lbs. and big and hairy myself!!)  So she admitted her perception of Bigfoot is like 8 or 9 feet- maybe he is, maybe he isn't- I don't claim to know.  Anyways, that's what she saw.  She says that she observed it through binoculars on two feet, and in stride, freeze, and come to a standstill stance that was the forward leg was bent at knee, and back leg trailing- arms (at least one) out along same plane, like literally freezing in stride while sort of stooping.  This is the way she described it to me, and is consistent with my own perception of what I would imagine a stance taken by someone or an animal when alerted, and when that something goes into freeze mode (hand-in-cookie-jar stance.)  Anyways, that's what she described.  No view of head.  She said she spotted with binocs, put them down and looked unaided, returned to binocs again and observed again, looked unaided again, but was gone when she looked through the third time.  She said that she got a little scared, but remained there for some time, and could not hear it, nor saw it again. My gut reaction is that she may have saw a Sasquatch, Bigfoot.  She is pretty straightup lady.  She has her own small business- we work hard.  Drink moderately hard, party some, raise a child, work, work. Over the years, I have heard walking in the woods which never revealed itself.  Although there is some hunting, it is not as much as one would suspect.  You have to \\\"draw\\\" to be able to legally hunt back there, and there are a lots of better places to hunt around here.  Mainly fishermen.   Also, I have talked to other individuals who also claim to have had first- hand or second-hand experiences in the general area, over the past 20 years.

G. and I am 48 years old. When I was a child I used to go to church camp at different camps through Public Welfare Assistance. We didn't have much money and my mother would send me to camp every summer. This summer was different for me for it was the first summer I was going to camp by myself. My sister would go with me in previous years. I am not sure where the camp is located other than it was near Mt. Rainier, Washington. The camp was named Camp Timberlake [now Camp Arnold]. This was a brand new camp and it was the opening summer for the camp. The camp had Boys Town and Girls Town. There was a lake that had a dock with a slide that spiraled. The dock floated out a few yards form the shore. All the cabins were \\\"A\\\" frames with a loft for the councilors. Between the boys' cabins and the girls' cabins was the dinning hall. I had a lot of fun that summer swimming, shooting guns and bow and arrows. The cabins were set within the fir trees and we had about eight boys per cabin. I think there were about fifty to seventy kids in camp. I was only about ten to twelve years old. (1965 - 1970) It was about the third day of camp when everything changed. We had retired for the night and everyone was in bed. I was awoken by loud noises. The counselor told us all to stay in our beds. I remember the boy who slept in the top bunk above me - I called him Silver Tooth for his front tooth was silver - looked out the window and said he saw several large hairy men around the water tower and the cabins and they were ten feet tall. I was scared so I hid under my covers and wished it would stop. The counselor was upset and said for us all to stay in our bed and to stay away from the door and windows. After what seemed to be hours the ruckus stopped and we went to sleep. The next morning when we went outside. Just in front of our cabin was a 30 to 40 foot fir tree tipped over and the root ball was up in the air with a hole in the ground about eight feet. There were human like foot prints everywhere. There must of been several of them and of different sizes. I saw hundreds of foot prints everywhere. They were from eight inches to maybe fourteen inches in length and depressed into the ground about a quarter of an inch. You could see the toes - think four or five -  I was pretty young and don't remember. They took us for a walk that day around the perimeter of the camp. I remember them telling us that the girls played a joke on us and that we were going to play a joke on them tonight. One counselors said you should see the dogs here they are five feet tall. As we walked, we came to the water tower where silver tooth saw the ten foot men, and there were large foot prints all around the water tower. When we got to the lake something had pulled a bunch of algae or sea weed out and it was everywhere. That night we played a scary record (didn't sound anything like the night before) and the counselor said we really got  back at those girls. When we woke up the next morning they told us we were going home early and we loaded the bus to come home two or three day early. Back in those days I never heard of Bigfoot. Later in my life the movie Bigfoot came out and I went to see the movie. When the Bigfoot came into the camp it brought me back to the night in camp and the noises I heard that night. As an adult I often think about that night and wonder how I could get a hold of someone else who was at Camp Timberlake that summer night. I know that all the adults must have seen them and even got some photos. My older sister said that she went to that camp on Mt. Rainer and at the gate it has a sign that says the only known sighting of Bigfoot. If you know of this sighting please, tell me how I can find more about it and maybe even visit the camp or get in touch with others that were there that night.

Our first exploration on the trip were the trails from the ranch to Traverse City.  We traveled through some forest to a high wire clearing that we felt had too much rugged terrain to continue.  We came to the first road in the high wire clearing and decided to turn around.  I was driving and my wife was riding in the passenger's seat. After turning around I looked across two hills from which we had just come and noticed what appeared on first impression, to be a cross country skier, 200 yards away, coming down the second hill away from us. Immediately many things bothered me about this cross country skier.  First, it was male and it was extremely tall, maybe 8 to 9 feet in height.  (It was very male because of its wide shoulder to slim waste shape)  Second, he appeared to traverse the steep down hill slope like a down hill skier attacking the slope in parallel skier motions but in very long foot steps instead of sliding skies in downhill parallel motion. No skies were noticed.  Third, and most puzzling, was that the figure was dark, dirty rusty, red from top of head to bottom of foot except for the face which was jet black. Finally the figure appeared very unnatural in movement. The entire sighting lasted a total of maybe 5 seconds. As I drove back over the area where I saw the figure I looked intently for cross country ski tracks.  I found none.  We also did not come across a skier and the area at the bottom of the hill dumped into a very thick wooded area blocked by a barbed wire fence. At the time I thought about stopping and looking for foot prints but was afraid of asking my wife if she saw what I thought I had just seen so I moved on. Whatever I saw bothered me all day.  Later in the evening I asked my wife if she noticed the cross country skier which I had seen. She had not seen the skier.  When I walked her through the event and told her that I think I saw a Bigfoot she just laughed and continues to laugh at me today. The sighting has continued to bother me over a month later.  I'm convinced that what I saw was too tall, was not clothed naturally, and moved too unnaturally to be a human.\", \"location_details\": \"I've described the location as best I can.

I am a Mason County resident that has lived here in Shelton for most of my life.My father was a State Fire Warden since the late 1950's up until his retirement in 1978,and my Mother was a floral greens harvester for about 50 years.Consiquently I know this area better than most residents as I also run a business that requires me to be in the woods a lot.I was employed by the USFS from 1970 to 1983 in Fire Management. My first encounter with what I believe to be a Sasquatch was in  October,1984.I was living in Oregon at the time and had came home to visit my folks who resided on the Cloqullam road about 3 miles west of Shelton.One evening as I was sleeping on their couch I heard a screaming noise off in the distance(I am estimating a 1/4 mile)that I can only describe as a cross between a donkey braying,a high pitched scream and a growling noise at the end.What amazed me most was the duration of this howling as it lasted about 15 seconds.About 5 minutes later it howled again, this time much closer to the house and repeats itself twice.I can still recall my parents watchdogs scratching at the door to get in.As the noise got closer I could hear a more distant but unquestionably return answer to the screaming. The thing finally got to within a couple hundred yards of the house and the noise was like an air raid siren.I have never heard any animal as loud as this.It screamed a couple of more times and then it headed back the way it came continuing to scream at intervals until it was a very distant noise and either was out of my range of hearing or had quit.The next morning I asked my parents if they had heard the noise from the previous night.They answered yes and told me that they had been hearing it for years. I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor. Other people in the area attested to hearing the noises.As a prologue to this about 3 weeks later my parent's dog came up missing and I found him on the pipeline.His neck was broken and he was severly torn up.I don't know if this had any thing to do with the noise but I have always wondered. My other encounter was in early fall of 1996.I was out with my dog checking on some leases I had with Simpson Timber Company.After my business was finished I stopped at an area I knew I could find some mushrooms to take home.This is in an area near the Satsop River and betwwen the Cloqullam road and the Matlock-Brady road.It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm and I only had about an hour of light left. My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing. It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events. I have since then found tracks in the same area which is only about 8 miles as the crow flys from my parents house.\", \"location_details\": \"Contact me\", \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 7580: Man shares encounters of an unknown subject\", \"latitude\": 47.2293, \"longitude\": -123.4898, \"date\": \"2004-11-16T00:00:00\", \"number\": 7580.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c22htvv6x5\", \"temperature_high\": 49.42, \"temperature_mid\": 41.435, \"temperature_low\": 33.45, \"dew_point\": 43.18, \"humidity\": 0.95, \"cloud_cover\": 0.77, \"moon_phase\": 0.16, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0035, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1022.03, \"summary\": \"Light rain in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 1.0, \"visibility\": 5.97, \"wind_bearing\": 205.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.96, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.4898 47.2293)\"}, {\"observed\": \"We live in a cabin just outside of town with a swampy bottom that contains lots of trees and deer. In 2010 was when I had my first experience with something very large. Unfortunately, I couldn't make out what it was, but it had chased me several feet before I got into the cabin. In 2011, I had my first sighting of a creature that was about 8 or 9 feet tall, with brownish black hair that contained some grey and red streaks. It had been raining earlier that day and it appeared to have long stringy hair, deep set eyes, and very broad shoulders. Then in 2012, when my daughter was painting the benches at the fire pit in the far corner of our property she came running onto the porch white as a ghost. My husband asked her if she saw a snake and she replied she thinks she seen what I had seen a year earlier. She explained it as a reddish color beast of some sort. On May 23, 2014, our four year old grandson was spending the night. We were outside earlier letting the grand kids light their sparklers when the four year old said he seen something. We went back into the cabin and started watching television. A little later he said to his pap and then myself while we were watching television, \\\"did you hear that growl?\\\" ...we replied no and he ran to the back of the couch to look outside our large picture window. A few moments later he replied there's a gorilla outside and then started describing the same thing I had seen. His mother and I have never mentioned anything about our experience in front of the children before because we didn't want to scare them. His older brother was so afraid of his description that he made us close all the blinds and lock all the doors. The next day, we asked him if he remembered anything from the night before and he replied, \\\"you mean the gorilla.\\\" We asked him to show us where he had seen it. Once he showed us the spot, fear instantly came over me to know it was just a few feet from the window. I called my parents because they are the property owners and they went out and bought two game cameras to put on the trees.  Since then, a three to four feet section of our firewood that is stacked around the fire pit was pushed inward. Considering it was pushed from the woods inward and there's about a four foot drop behind the woodpile it was quite concerning to us. Finally, on May 25th, our granddaughter went out with us to sit on the porch and cried out dog... dog and looked overcome with fear. My husband grabbed the flashlight and saw something take off running. He then ran around the cabin to see what it was and it had already crossed over the bank at the property line.

As we were lighting the fire, I heard a loud howling coming over the hills. I stopped and asked my cousin if he heard the noise too. At first he acknowledged hearing the dogs barking off in the distance. However, he did notice the howling I was talking about. We both stood at the fire and listened to the howling continue for a couple of minutes. We are not from around this area, so he asked me what I thought it was that might be howling like that. I told him it was probably a bear...but it was still some distance away...my estimate being 4-5 miles. We brushed the noise off, and went back inside. The next morning i tried as best as i could to describe the sound to my girlfriends parents, who are residents of the area. They told me they dont know what i heard...but it did not seem to resemble a bear because bears in this area do not howl like that. The next day, I happened to be watching MonsterQuest on the History Channel. It was about Bigfoot legends from around the US and they happened to play a clip from a unknown howling recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio in 1994. As soon as I heard the howling...i recognized it. It was the EXACT same sound we had heard the night before. I decided to google Columbiana County, Bigfoot, 1994 and actually found the clip of the sound on this website. I listened to it...and am 100% positive that was the exact noise i heard. I sent the clip to my cousin, and he too confirmed that was the noise that he heard as well.

As we were driving about 60 yards down the road, we see a black creature that i would say to be around seven feet tall come running up the the steep bank and across the road at an unhuman speed. about 10-15 feet behind it another creature of the same size and color came running across at an ever faster speed. Needless to say i gunned it to try to get closer to get a better look at what i had just seen. within about 10mseconds they were long gone into the manzanita bushes. i got out of the truck and was listening and could hear nothing at all. with the hair on my neck standing up and goose bumps me and my friend went back to camp and started telling my father what had just happened. He found it comical and thought that we were trying to mess with him until that night when my friend was almost in tears begging to leave the woods. we ended up packing up camp and going home at 10:30pm. so last night me and my father started looking up info. and sightings on bigfoot in the area. After reading all of this we started putting things together, and decided to go back today and look for clues. the first thing that really caught out eyes was reading of their stench. less than 500 yards from whare i saw the creatures cross the street were were cutting wood the day before and noticed a rotten small that we had smelled about 5 years before when camped by there. so we decided to go look for tracks and to see what was making the bad smell. so when we go there we decided to go look for the smell first. Its strongest point ended up being down this grown over cat road about 400 yards. we could find nothing that would be causing the smell but the one thing that really gave my goose bumps was there was small trees about three inches in diameter snapped about two feet up laying across the road where the smell was the most potient.(I read the night before to watch for small broken trees. after not finding anything that could be causing this smell we decided to go look for tracks where they crossed the street. after looking for about twenty minutes we found what look like a long and wide print that had no distinguishable toes or tread. about 15ft from the print we found some feces that were what i thought to be a bear but my dad said noway so needless to say i now have a bag of s*&t that i have no idea what it came from. now to describe the figures we say run across the road. they ran completely upright and at speeds of a deer. i could not really see its face. it had longer arms that than a human and ran straight armed. and last it was solid black\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Wasco County\", \"state\": \"Oregon\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 26718: Late night road crossing sighting by hunters near the eastern boundary of Mt.

From a childhood spent in North Georgia to stints in West Virginia and now (for the past 16 years) in Virginia, I have spent a great bit of time in the woods. I know animals and flora and that is why what occurred back in the fall of '03 has bothered me so much to this day, enough to finally submit this report. My former roommate's father owns the property this incident took place on. I have had access to it since I was 15. It's a small sportsman\\u2019s paradise of nearly 200 acres and a 5-acre bass pond. I had hunted it every fall since '94 and had fished there for years before that. I hit the woods, completely scent proof, at about 3:30AM and hiked from the farmhouse appx. 600 yards back to the deer stand I was planning on using that morning. I stopped short about 100 yards to apply a drag rope (doe in rut scent) and then crossed the creek bridge and walked a wide pattern out in front of the stand to put out several scent markers on the game trails. This took perhaps 15 minutes and no game animals were spooked. I then headed back towards the tree stand, tied off my rifle and gear to a safety rope, climbed the stand and pulled up my gear. This would give me a full hour and a half to let the woods settle down and help my presence go unnoticed. What happened next has cost me countless nights of sleep and still gives me chills every time I think about it. Once in the stand I went about the business of sorting out my gear and making sure everything was where I would need it, binoculars, grunt caller, etc. Out of nowhere came the most god awful, blood-curling scream/yell/growl that I had ever heard in my life. The morning calm was completely shattered and it sounded close. I immediately ran the a mental list in my mind as to what it could be, but nothing I had ever heard before could match this in either pitch, depth, or duration. It lasted for at least 5-7 seconds. I was scared. It started so high and just kept expanding in pitch into a howl that ended in a menacing guttural growl. Before the sound was even over I realized/felt extreme danger. The real fear was from the fact that the volume was so loud and it came upon me so suddenly that I knew it was close, too close, within say 25 yards. Following the \\\"howl\\\" there was complete silence. I immediately felt to close to the ground, for whatever reason (in a 17ft. tree stand), and carefully stood up so that my feet were not dangling off the seat. I pulled out my mag light and started scanning the area to my front and right that the sound seemed to come from. I tried to listen for further movement while scanning, but realized that my ears were actually ringing from the howl. I remember thinking (from previous survival training) to keep cool and not panic, and figure this out. I quickly chambered a round and checked to make sure the safety was on my rifle, a Winchester model 70 in .300WSM. I then continued scanning between the woods to my front and the pine thicket to my immediate right with my flashlight. I just felt so vulnerable, and remembered thinking that this rifle might not be enough so I fetched my S&W.40 handgun from my backpack and secured it to my belt (now I know that it's unlawful to carry a sidearm during rifle season, but there are black bear on this property and I wasn\\u2019t going to leave myself without an option). It took several moments for my hearing to return and when it did I heard distinctive movement back in the pine thicket to my front and right, maybe 20 yards into the trees. Then nothing. That\\u2019s when the smell hit me. I'm not sure I noticed it at first because I had been handling deer scents, but I smelled what I can only describe as a \\\"rotten cabbage/ripe dumpster\\\". It didn\\u2019t last long, and there was no noticeable wind at the time of this incident to carry this scent. I stood there in that tree stand for the next two hours until first light and then got the hell out of there. I'm not the type to scare easily and I was right back out there two days later, but didn\\u2019t think to check for tracks or any other evidence. The game was still scarce. I've been back several times since then to fish the pond and nothing out of the ordinary ever occurred during those trips. I totally forgot about this incident for nearly a year. It bothered me so I just didn\\u2019t think about it. That changed when I caught a documentary on T.V. concerning bigfoot/Sasquatch. The BFRO was mentioned and I found your website out of curiosity. I was stunned when I read the report (also in Franklin Co.) that you had listed, but was even further stunned when I listened to some of the recording in your database. Several (from '73 and '78 I think) sounded similar to the very beginning of the howl during my incident, but the sound I heard was so close and loud and went so deep at the end that they are tough to compare. Whatever made that noise had one hell of a set of lungs though. I was also surprised about the smell that \\\"they\\\" supposedly emit when threatened. I had no idea. That was the icing on the cake that made me think that I might have possibly had an encounter. I've always been someone comfortable in the woods, and for the most part I'm still that person, I'm just a little more aware of what could possibly be out there.\", \"location_details\": \"From Roanoke: 220 South to Rocky Mount, then 40 West past Ferrum College\", \"county\": \"Franklin County\", \"state\": \"Virginia\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 13212: Possible pre-dawn vocalization heard by hunter near Ferrum\", \"latitude\": 36.94165, \"longitude\": -80.04166, \"date\": \"2003-11-13T00:00:00\", \"number\": 13212.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dnx44t52wn\", \"temperature_high\": 45.65, \"temperature_mid\": 38.555, \"temperature_low\": 31.46, \"dew_point\": 21.67, \"humidity\": 0.4, \"cloud_cover\": 0.24, \"moon_phase\": 0.64, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0002, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.11, \"summary\": \"Breezy throughout the day and partly cloudy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 3.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 295.0, \"wind_speed\": 17.47, \"location\": \"POINT(-80.04166 36.94165)\"}, {\"observed\": \"around july-2004 my self and some friends were camping at Rocky Fork Lake in Cloumbia, Mo. we were standing around a camp fire and were proceeding to cookup some dinner when something came from the south side of our site. it sounded like a huge animal. it ran past our site..it came as close as 6-8 feet of us. it circled us three times and then ran to the lake front . it made a whaling  sound from the water area. it was a high pitch howl that sounded as it was attacking something. it sounded as a pig squealing. it ran behind us.\", \"location_details\": \"the location was at the Rocky Fork Lake which is part of the FingerLake Park located outside of columbia\", \"county\": \"Boone County\", \"state\": \"Missouri\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 27023: Huge animal screams and circles campsite at Finger Lake Park\", \"latitude\": 39.08817, \"longitude\": -92.31901, \"date\": \"2004-07-13T00:00:00\", \"number\": 27023.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9yyq75z355\", \"temperature_high\": 93.73, \"temperature_mid\": 82.95, \"temperature_low\": 72.17, \"dew_point\": 75.97, \"humidity\": 0.77, \"cloud_cover\": 0.06, \"moon_phase\": 0.88, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1013.54, \"summary\": \"Humid throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 9.96, \"wind_bearing\": 263.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.68, \"location\": \"POINT(-92.31900999999999 39.08817)\"}, {\"observed\": null, \"location_details\": \"It happened in Bancroft park in Lansing\", \"county\": \"Ingham County\", \"state\": \"Michigan\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 49621: Teen recounts possible encounter while walking in a Lansing city park\", \"latitude\": 42.75195, \"longitude\": -81.52805, \"date\": \"2015-04-01T00:00:00\", \"number\": 49621.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dpw50yc04t\", \"temperature_high\": 46.36, \"temperature_mid\": 40.17, \"temperature_low\": 33.98, \"dew_point\": 30.62, \"humidity\": 0.79, \"cloud_cover\": 0.63, \"moon_phase\": 0.41, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1019.36, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 137.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.21, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.52805 42.75195)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have been a police officer in Nevada for over 19 years. In 2004 two of my college roommates called me from Idaho, and wanted to set up a climb to Boundary Peak. Boundary Peak is the highest mountain in Nevada at over 13.000 feet. It is located in the White Mountains East of Bishop, California. One of my roommates is a loan executive for a bank in Idaho, and the other is a farmer. We left Boundary Peak trailhead on the last Saturday morning of July, 2004 around 0600 am. Around 2:00 p.m. we were several hundred feet from the summit of Boundary Peak. There were two climbers making their way down the trail towards us. The last 300 feet of the climb is steep with lots of obstacles, and the trail is very narrow. We waited at our location so that the two climbers combing down would have room to pass on the trail. As we were waiting I spotted a lone climber making his way across the rim rock trail between Montgomery Peak and Boundary Peak. He caught my attention, because he kicked a rock off the West side slope of the sheer rock cliff. When the two climbers reached our location I observed something moving south about 300 feet down from us in a large bowl. The movement was too fast to be another climber, because the area that it was in was full of small shale rock. This rock is extremely hard to walk in and keep your balance on the steep mountain side. There were also several large boulders in with the shale rock where the trail was that this climber was using. When I first observed this subject, I said out loud; \\\"Look at that guy go. He is wearing a funny hairy climbing suit.\\\" My first thought was that he was some expert climber wearing a modern high tech climbing suit. All five of us looked at what I just pointed out, and there was a dead calm silence among us. We all sat there for about two minutes and watched as this creature made its way to the trees below us. While I was watching it, I made the listed observation: This creature would run on two legs upright until it came up on a large boulder, and then it would crawl over it on all four legs and run for a while on all four legs. After a short distance, it would stand back up on two legs and run until it came up to another obstacle. This creature was between 5' and 5'6\\\" tall. Its arms hung down to almost its knees. The head area appeared to have a long hair around the face and head. It appeared to be a light brown in color with darker hair around the head and groin area. Once it reached an area of heavy vegetation, we lost sight of it. It took over 90 seconds to reach the vegetation from the first place that we observed it. I asked the other climbers if they knew what it was that we just saw. They did not say anything. My first thought was that it looked like an orangutan. I told this to one of my friends and they replied, \\u201cYeh, maybe it escaped from captivity...\\u201d Everyone left it at that and we all started back up the summit, while the other climbers made their way down. Before the other climbers left, I asked them where they were from and they said Southern California. As we were going back up I spotted the other lone climber crossing the divide between the peaks. He was about 1/2 mile south of Boundary Peak. I thought to my self that this climber might have scared the creature from his hiding place when he knocked a rock off the cliff. Once we were on the peak, the lone climber met up with us. He was an Asian male. I asked him if he saw anything down the South slope of the divide that he just came across. He said he didn't see anything (i.e. anything unusual). All three of us in our climbing party had cameras. They were all in our back packs when we observed the creature. I initially thought of trying to take my gloves off and taking off my pack to get my camera out. I realized that my camera did not have a zoom on it, and that a regular 35mm would only show a dark spot at a distance of over 300 yards. When I returned home I told a couple of my close friends about the creature that I saw. I did not want a lot of people to know about what I saw, because I did not want them to think that I was loosing it. In February of 2007 I bought 10 acres of land about 5 miles from the area that I saw the creature. I did not know it at the time, but this is where I am going to retire. I was talking to one of the local residence and I told them about what I saw up on the mountain. They did not seem surprised, and told me about a local prospector who saw something in the forest that scared him to the point that he does not want to talk about it ever again. \", \"location_details\": \"It was about 1,000 feet S.E. of the peak to Boundary Peak Mt.\", \"county\": \"Esmeralda County\", \"state\": \"Nevada\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 22386: Daylight sighting by Reno police officer and two friends on Boundary Peak Mtn.\", \"latitude\": 37.8583, \"longitude\": -118.325, \"date\": \"2004-10-15T00:00:00\", \"number\": 22386.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qez77yked\", \"temperature_high\": 61.08, \"temperature_mid\": 42.435, \"temperature_low\": 23.79, \"dew_point\": 10.43, \"humidity\": 0.29, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.06, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 170.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.0, \"location\": \"POINT(-118.325 37.8583)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian \\u201crelic\\u201d hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe \\u00be of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills\\u2026goosebumps running my entire body\\u2026and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large \\u201cshadow\\u201d\\u2026easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me\\u2026and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn\\u2019t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain\\u2026a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000\\u2026I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But\\u2026he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close\\u2026just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it \\u201cI\\u2019m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don\\u2019t mean no trouble for you\\u201d. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that \\u201cBigfoot\\u201d was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn\\u2019t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So\\u2026I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real\\u2026and not something else. I haven\\u2019t shared this story with very many people\\u2026but maybe this is the time to do it.\", \"location_details\": \"I have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards.

The evening was spent cooking hotdogs & hamburgers & marshmallows & sa'mores with lots of singing laughing & screaming. We all retired around 10 pm.

We were taking a last minute look at my garden which is very close to the house.  We had only been out there a couple of minutes and then we heard the most unusual screaming sound.  My daughter asks if it was a coyote and I said NO and ushered her back to the house.  The call came less than 150 feet from the house.  It was loud and remarkable.  The dog that usually barks and runs after everything ran under the house. I did not say what I thought it was to her; instead we looked on the internet for sounds that might occur, like coyotes, panthers, fox, Barn owls, etc. After going through the whole directory.  She asks what the sound was.  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings.  Our stomachs turned. Yes, that is exactly what it sounded like.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I grew up listening to coyotes and the occasional panther, bobcats, owls, Ferrell dogs and deer they all can make weird sounds.  But this, this is crazy.  I never thought that I would hear something like that in my woods.  I live in the river bottoms and I remember when I was young we heard the same sound, that was over thirty years ago. When I thought back on what happened, I realized that before we left the house my inside dog and cat were acting strange, pacing and panting. When we exited the house to go to the garden I should have known something was not quite right.  There were no night time sounds.. No crickets or frogs .. Just silence.. I finally put on my brave face and escorted my daughter to her car and pretended like everything is ok.  I could still hear snaps and cracks in the woods.  I watched her drive off then quickly got back in the house.  In the morning......I'll go look for other evidence, for now you couldn't pay me to go outside and I don't spook easy at all!

Forest).  To get to the property, which was located many miles from civilazation, you had to travel on a very rough road (one cut with a dozer) so our motor home could not make it to our lot. Near by was a small pond and a campsite that was for the use of property owners. The pond was about 75 to 100 feet across, the banks were covered in cat tails and the pond was full of trout (we tried all day to catch some fish, without luck). My family(wife, son and 2 daughters) were aware of how quiet it was in the evening, we could not even get a station on the radio. We built a camp fire and were sitting around it watching the field mice run down to the edge of the pond to get a drink. As I remember it was a bright night, the moon was visible overhead. Along about 10 or 11 pm, the wife and kids went into the camper and went to bed. I remained outside by the camp fire trying to get a station on the walkman radio. About 1am, I was putting out the fire when I saw movement on the other side of the pond, I noticed the movement because of the noise this thing was making. At first I thought it was a deer (I was told they were common in the area) so with that thought I headed toward the sound armed with my trusty flashlite. As I approached, the moonlite was very bright, I could see lots of movement in the cat tails but could not see the animal. At this point it hit me that maybe it was a mountain lion, because I could hear a low rumbling sound like a cat purring but much louder. I decided to return to the motor home, as I turned to retrace my steps (I was probably 50 feet from the noise) this huge hulk stood up in front of me and made a loud screeching noise. It raised up to a full standing position, I would say 7 or 8 ft tall, dark brownish hair.  We looked at each other for a moment and then I turned and ran full speed away from him.  When I looked back to see if he was following me, he was walking in the opposite direction toward the deep forest. I stood and watched him until he disappeared in the deep woods. He did not walk like an animal but more like a man. When I composed myself, I went back to the area I saw him at to look for tracks, but all I found was crushed cat tails, an area of about 10 ft in dia was all smashed down, and it smelled like a strong urine smell in the area. I told the family what I saw and to this day they think I saw a deer or some other animal. I tell this story now to my grand children when we go camping.

A group of 75 kids age 7 to 17 and the camp personel.  From a huge pasture area all the campers walked down a trail that was thick with blackberry bushes and was lightly treed with alder, etc.  The trail was about 200 yards long.  At the end of the trail, there was a circular clearing about 150 feet in diameter.  This is where the group set up camp.  There were 3 trails out of the clearing.  The one going to the pasture, one going to the river (over a little rise and about 100 feet away from the clearing) and one trail that deadended 50 feet up.  This is where the campers were to relieve themselves.  A group of 4 twelve year old girls were going to relieve themselves down this trail at about 11pm.  From deep in the berry bushes, we heard something moving.  It sounded like the animal would move a little ways, then stop.  We could hear branches and twigs snapping.  We couldn't figure out what it could be because it was such a thicket of berries.  No human could be in there without getting massively scratched.  We listened for quite awhile and noticed whatever it was was moving closer to us, but it was still a ways away.  Getting scared, we ran back to our sleeping bags.  There was a big circle of girls in their sleeping bags and our group of 5 was off to the side, near the \\\"bathroom\\\" trail.  I listened for a long time from my sleeping bag & noticed the animal was getting closer.  I got up from my friends & moved into the center of the circle of girls!  I fell fast asleep.  One of my best friends did not.  What Jane heard as she lay awake was whatever it was, eventually came out of from the berry bushes.  There were 2 of them.  They communicated by making soft cooing noises to each other that sounded very much like pigeons.  Jane was laying on her stomach in a goosedown sleeping bag with her head on her arms & was petrified.  She could not look up at what was in our camp because she was afraid of what she might see.  She said the two creatures moved all around our camp.  If someone stirred in their sleeping bag, they would stop moving & make no noise.  She could hear them get in our boxes of food.  They continued exploring our camp for hours, intermittantly calling softly to each other.  All the while she is stiff as a board in her sleeping bag.  Then to top it all off, one of them steps on the end of her sleeping bag & she feels the whoosh of the air coming up to her feet.  She moved her feet.  Whatever it was reached down and lightly touched her back!  She - even MORE petrified, just layed there, hoping it wouldn't hurt her or carry her away! I woke at dawn from the center of the big circle of girls & got up to go relieve myself.  Jane was laying in her bag exactly as I described.  She hadn't moved & the down bag was literally soaking wet with her sweat.  I believe she was in mild shock.  She dull-ly told us what happened to her, but she was so wrung out, there was little emotion she showed.  My friends and I walked all over looking for some sign of what she said happened but since the ground was dry, there weren't any distinguishable footprints.  Later when we got back to the Aqua Barn, Jane layed in bed the rest of the day to recover. Our group, to this day, calls this incident \\\"The thing that came to camp!\\\"  Since I was not greatly affected by this, it's fun for me to recall.  Jane and I talked about this incident in 1990 and she IS NOT happy to relate it!

I was in the Air Force, stationed in Sumter, SC (Shaw AFB) and was traveling home to N. Myrtle Beach, SC with my two young sons (7 and 5)--they were asleep in the back seat.  I had worked that day and had spent time with my neighborhood friends after work.  I was a single parent and my children hated to ride in the car, so I had intentially started my trip very late--about 11pm.  Trip was pretty much uneventful (as always) until about 1am.  As I was traveling one of the many shortcuts I had found (hwy 917) and just passed the Little Pee Dee River, I noticed what I thought was a dog in a ditch.  As I approached, the animal turned and looked at the car and I immediately knew that this was no dog.  It was stooped over in the ditch, maybe eating a deer carcass or some other road kill.  When it turned there was a couple of things that I noticed first...  It's face almost looked like an orangutan's, there was no fur on the face and it had lips that had no real shape to them, the mouth was wider than a man's, the lips were pursed together and very narrow.  It's head seem to be wider than normal with scraggely fur on top.  The fur had an orange-brown tint to it (thus the thought that it was a dog).  It was in the process of standing straight up when it turned to look at me, almost picking itself up in the process.  Therefore, I know that it was not an animal that I had ever seen before.  I did NOT get a chance to look at it in it's full length since I passed and could not see it in the mirror.  It did not appear to have a neck, and was much broader in the shoulder and chest area than it initially appeared.  Again, I did not notice much about the legs since I did not see much of them--I will say that the chest was MUCH larger than the mid (and butt) section and it never turned fully around--but what I did notice was the arms.  They were very long and what appeared to be fingers were curved up into it's palms (not a fist)--therefore, making me believe it was some sort of ape--that maybe it mostly walked on all fours like a chimpanzee). It was covered from head to toe (with exception to the already mentioned facial area in the orange-brown fur...It had two apparent arms, I never really saw the legs since they were underneath the animal and hidden by the ditch and was much larger than I had initially thought.  The ditch was probably 3 to 4 feet deep and the animal (stooped or bent over) rose above the ditch about 4 to 5 more feet.  Another reason why the dog scenario did not fit the bill.  The reason I knew the animal was stooped or bent over was because when it turned to look at me, it had to push itself up out of the ditch with it's arms (hands, I assume) and turn around--it was initially facing in the direction I was driving (SSE) and was apparently standing, still slightly stooped over, when I passed.  It was a very dark night and I could only see the animal with the headlights.  I was driving about 65 and when I saw the animal, I slowed down--thought it was going to run out in front of me--I had deer do that to me before... When I passed I looked in the mirror, but it was too dark to make any discernable shape in the ditch.  I certainly did not stop as I was sort of tripped out and I had my two young sons in the car with me.

We had over 125 acres in the back yard nothing but woods. The woods were covered in trees and little creeks. Me and my friends always played in the woods. For years we would find crazy things out there that just didn't make sense like trees bent over and I remember a big hole like 20 feet deep maybe 40 feet wide round. We called it the hole. Well we decided to transport our horses behind our house so we cut down about 4 acres of trees, leveled it off and built a barn and fenced the area in. About 5 months later after everything was built and finished I would get bored and I would go in the pasture and hang out with the horses, feeding them just hanging out. I have 3 horses: Rambo, a Tennessee Walker, all black and 17 hands high. Reno, a Blanket Apaloosa, grey/white, 12 hands high. And Dakota, a Morgan red tone, 13 hands high. I was in the pasture standing by my horses Rambo and Reno. The pasture had a barn in the far back, in the right corner.  As I'm standing by Reno and Rambo I heard some movement in the brush to my right. To the left of the barn about 40 yards from me as I turned and looked, my horses Reno and Rambo spooked and ran toward my house away from the barn. As I look at this thing, I could only see the left front side of it facing me, hidden in the brush. The color was a red auburn. I thought, what is Dakota doing? Then I realize this thing is outside of the fence. I thought Dakota got out so as I walk toward what I thought was my horse, Dakota. At that time, Dakota runs out of the barn beside me and runs to the house. At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck. This up-right walking figure stepped to its left, made a grunt sound/breathing, looked right at me then turned pushing small trees and brush over and taking off into the woods. It was about 8 1/2 feet tall, massive in size and covered in red hair. The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped, very strong. As it took off you could hear the foot steps, very heavy. I ran towards the house and told my mom and everyone just looked at me like I was crazy. So I kept it to myself. This is my first sighting. Then about 9 months ago in 2012 I had another sighting.

(Sorry I can't be more specific.) Some friends and I had taken to exploring the woods that surrounded our town. We were constantly in the woods for one reason or another. On this particular morning, I think it was around 0900, only one of my friends was able to accompany me into the woods. We followed our normal trail to the rim of Curry Hollow, which was about 400yds into the woods. We strung some ropes, and went down the incline. It was steep enough that the ropes were necessary. When we got to the floor of the hollow we started walking through a section of woods that we hadn\\u2019t checked out yet. Mostly we were just wandering, and seeing what was in the area. At that time of my life I had a started developing an interest in the outdoors and wildlife, so whenever we were in the woods I tried to make sure we were quiet enough not to scare away any animals. We all enjoyed trying to track the different species in the area. In our wanderings we had found raccoon dens, snake and bird nests and even tracked a few deer through the trees and brush so when we saw the animal stand up in front of us we knew instantly that this was something different. We were coming up on a deadfall that had been covered over with vines and surrounded by small saplings since it had fallen. We started to go around the fallen tree (it was approx. 80 to 100 feet long and 2 \\u00bd feet wide and the crown caused it to be about three to four feet off the ground) and had made it to the base when we both spotted a humped shape covered with brown hair or fur. The shape was about 10 feet in front of us and was close to a tangle of vines and brush. We both froze and just stared. We had both been told that though they were rare in the area, some people had seen bear in and around these woods. And that\\u2019s what we thought it was, and we knew we were to close. Thinking it might be injured since was so still, I decided we should go home and let my father know a local cop know about it. I glanced to my friend and motioned to him that we should go back the way we came. We had just started to turn when the shaped stood up and took off running. When it stood, we saw was that it was at least 2 feet taller than us. At the time we were both around 5\\u2019 5\\u201d. When it started running was when I got scared, it was on two legs. It cleared a good 20yds through the brush in what seemed like a split second. We instantly took off the other way and didn\\u2019t stop until we had made it up the rope and out of the woods. We didn't discuss it at the time. Later that week we talked and told some friends, and few days later we went back to the area with 3 more people. We found the tangle of brush the figure was behind and saw a large clear space, the size of which a small family of deer would have made, but there were no tracks, neither foot-prints or hoof-prints. The ground cover was a thick mat of leaves over the entire area. We noticed nothing else out of the ordinary. At that time I had seen bears in the zoo and on nature programs. And had seen them stand up on two legs. This was not a bear. It moved too fast and did it upright. And it certainly wasn\\u2019t a deer, or a big dog or anything else I had ever seen outside of a movie. When the figure stood up it was a good 2 feet taller than us so that would put it around 7'5\\\". It had it's back to us and I got a good perspective of it's bulk. It was muscled but not fat like a bear. And it had sloping shoulders. That was all I saw. I started running around that time. I've read about a foul smell others have noticed during their encounters, but I noticed nothing like this. It did make a lot of noise as it ran, crashing thru the brush and trees. It ran in the direction of road which splits the hollow in half. The other side of the hollow has less steeply angled sides and would have been much easier to climb. Plus there was more wooded area on that side of the hollow. I have never spoken to anyone about this since that summer. I knew no one who would have believed me.\", \"location_details\": \"Curry hollow is a steep sided valley the leads from the Monongahela river and Route 837 in Dravosburg to Lebanon Church Road and the Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin.

The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river. In late summer and fall of '79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm, so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them.  Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river.  The first time I heard them, I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl, but it really didn't sound like either, and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged. I really didn't think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11:00pm.  It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well.  I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger.  My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up.  At the same time my dog, a large doberman pinscher, started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline. I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace.  Right at that instant, something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us.  The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible.  I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream.  My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us, but it wasn't.  I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times.  Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from, that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth.  I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them. The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before.  I also know for sure that they weren't bobcat screams.  I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest.  The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me.  But I never saw anything.  I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house, spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn't following me. A few nights later, I was up late about 1:30am and getting ready for bed.  I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house.  He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly.  It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious.  I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house. The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house.  My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously.  Then I saw a large, sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house.  The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow.  Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows.  I was petrified with fear. I finally picked up my riot shotgun and chambered a round of buckshot.  My dog, at this time, was staring towards the north window of the spare bedroom and was still stiff and but not growling quite as bad.  I got up enough nerve to look out the bathroom window but saw nothing.  My yard was surrounded by a 3 ft high, hog-wire fence with two strands of barbed wire on top of it and locked steel gates, so whatever it was, stepped over the fence to get into and out of my yard.  The gates made a lot of noise if you tried to climb or open them, so it didn't come or go through the gates. In the next few weeks, while I was walking through the woods near the river, in two different locations, I found several deer that had been killed.  At the time, I thought that poachers had done it, but they were all complete except for having their abdomens cut or torn open and the guts pulled out.  None of the meat was gone from any of them, other than what possums or coons had eaten, and most of them had broken legs.  Only one was a buck and it was a yearling spike.  One of the deer had been killed right where I found it.  There were broken limbs and saplings and hair all around it.  There were tufts of deer hair hung in the bark of two larger trees next to the carcass.  Some of the tufts were over 10 feet off the ground.  Both of the deer's back legs were broken and twisted.  Even then I thought that it looked like something had grabbed that deer by the back legs and beaten it to death against the trees. I didn't tell anyone about any of this.  My dad and other folks had told me that people had been hearing and seeing strange things along that part of the river for decades.  But I had a neighbor that had told about seeing a bigfoot on his property a few years earlier and everybody laughed at him. In early fall of 1980, my wife was bringing in the wash one night about 7:00pm.  I had fed the horses some oats about 30 minutes earlier and I was now in the kitchen and suddenly heard a scream outside.  I ran out and my wife was running in, scared nearly to death. Something was right outside the gate between the storage shed and tack room/stables screaming just like before.  The horses went running out of there wide open.  The fence and gate there is quite high because there is a corral there also.  I could hear it moving around but could only get a glimpse of it occasionally.  It was MUCH taller than the 6 ft fence there and it appeared to be black with maybe a little silver or grey mixed in.  There's a steetlight in our yard on that side of the house, and when it moved though a patch of light, I could see the light glint off of its fur.  It was tall enough that it hit or shoved aside some tree limbs that I have to jump to be able to touch.  It screamed several more times and I could tell that it was becoming more agitated.  Between screams, I could hear it making a very eerie strange noise with an intermittent clicking sound that sounded like it was growling as it chewed or moved its mouth.   I ran back in the house and locked the doors. We moved shortly after that and I spent hardly any time on the farm until we moved back to the area in 1997.  My son, daughter and I and a couple of friends were coon hunting on the back of the farm near the river last year (November 1999) and the dogs were down on the east side of a ridge and we were waiting up on the top of the ridge for them to tree.  We started to hear the same screams as before about 600 yards to the west of us, in one of the areas where I had found dead deer before.  The screams lasted maybe 30 seconds to a minute and then stopped. We had tried to get the dogs to go in that direction earlier, and they wouldn't and we tried again later, but they kept circling back around and going to the truck, and these are championship dogs.  I didn't get to go back in the woods there until April of this year (2000).  I found fresh deer bones in the area where I had found several dead deer 20 years before. After finding your website and reading about the bigfoot killing deer, I now know that it hasn't been poachers killing all of our deer.  I believe that I will probably find more evidence of activity because the deer population is increasing in our area. .\", \"location_details\": \"East of Muscle Shoals.

I no longer live in Washington but now in Colorado. When I saw the creature go into the forest I stayed frozen for a good 15 minutes listening to hear if it might be coming.

This animal in no way sounded like that of a bear or anything else I have heard in the past. Finding your web site and listening to the recordings of moaning and such brought chills up my back!!! They sound so familiar to that night but I still cannot be certain. We have a small spaniel mix dog that sleeps in our basement garage area located under our home. Upon hearing the howling outside that night, the dog moved to the garage door area located directly under the bedroom window and barked like being startled from sleep three times. I could tell, the creature I had heard moaning and howling moved to the garage door under our open bedroom window (which is two stories high) and growled \\\"very deep\\\" at our barking dog while \\\"striking or smacking\\\" above the garage door. The dog STOPPED barking! Then I heard nothing out of our dog or from the animal outside the window again that night. I was too frightened to move and look outside.

This patio faces pretty dense wooded area on three angles back there. Something just made me feel uncomfortable even in daylight hours out there that I had not felt before since moving here.

That is when a large hand reached out from behind this brush and grabbed a handful of berries. I had to be 8 or 10 feet away at the time. The hand was huge with long reddish brown hair. It was clear that it was a hand and NOT a paw. I stood there in total shock.When I managed to run, I ran for my life. It did not chase me or anything, but I saw all that I wanted to see of it. The hand was scary enough, I probably would have died of fright had I seen the rest of it. I got back into camp which was not far away, but far enough for my napping cousin and uncle not to hear anything. I never screamed or made a sound, I just ran and sat as close to that camper as I could. I realized when I sat down in the fine dirt that I had wet my shorts.I was 7 years old and I had never done that before! I kept my mouth shut until my Mother and my other uncles and aunts (That were from Oregon) got back from antelope/elk sightseeing. I told them everything and they told me that it had to have been a bear. I described the color of the hair and I was told that it must have been black hair that I had seen, because this area only had black bears. I wasn't stupid. I knew the difference between a hand and a paw and the difference between reddish brown and black. I managed to let them convince me that it must have been a bear and we left and came back to our home state of Mississippi. A few years later I was in 6th grade. We had a library period and we could look for and check out books. I found a book with a black cover and if I am not mistaken, the title was \\\"Bigfoot\\\". I hurried to check this book out and read it from cover to cover. It wasn't until that moment that I figured out that the animal that I had seen those years earlier had a name. I had never been so excited in my life! Ever since, I have been interested in all sightings, shows, books, etc. of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti/Skunkape. I have thought about telling my story for years, but I, like everyone else, have been afraid of the teasing and skeptisism of others. My family says \\\"We believe that YOU believe what you saw.\\\" I will believe it until the day I die. I am 29 now and I hope that the mystery will be solved in my lifetime. My husband and my son believe me more than my Mom, Dad, Aunts, Uncles and cousins. I am very genuine and honest and I would never lie about something like that. I don't know why I was one of the chosen people to have had the opportunity to see even just a tiny part of this mysterious creature.

The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didn\\u2019t take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite. From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? That\\u2019s when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 5\\u20196\\u201d son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12\\u201d taller and three times bigger around than my son. Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched. I never felt threatened or perceived any danger or I certainly would have moved my boys right out of there. It seems to me that it had been watching us and once we had left its area and gotten back to ours it was more than happy to move on its way.\", \"location_details\": \"Mahlon Dickerson Reservation\", \"county\": \"Morris County\", \"state\": \"New Jersey\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 29139: Afternoon sighting while hiking at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation\", \"latitude\": 41.01941, \"longitude\": -74.57013, \"date\": \"2013-02-15T00:00:00\", \"number\": 29139.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dr6cr57eqh\", \"temperature_high\": 49.84, \"temperature_mid\": 39.27, \"temperature_low\": 28.7, \"dew_point\": 28.78, \"humidity\": 0.74, \"cloud_cover\": 0.32, \"moon_phase\": 0.19, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0001, \"precip_probability\": 0.39, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.84, \"summary\": \"Light snow overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 3.03, \"wind_bearing\": 245.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.27, \"location\": \"POINT(-74.57013 41.01941)\"}, {\"observed\": \"[Note - At their request, the witness's names were removed from this report.] It was back a few years ago when we were still scouting put-ins and take outs on the non- commercial sections of the San Juan River.

We could not find any real information either in print or on the web about the river from Shiprock, Nm,  down to Montezuma Creek Utah. We had to explore it ourselves via kayaks and canoes. Nowadays, we have a river company through the Navajo Tribe, and take people down this sections all the time. We found a put-in at mile ten just out side of Shiprock.

When you drive down the highway there are signs directing people to drive up in the nearby hills in case of tidal waves. It was up these dirt roads that my husband and I were hunting. The weather was cold in the morning, there was frost on the ground, by noon it had warmed up and was mild out. This is written from the view of someone who at the time of this incident knew very little of big foot, and really didn't give them any thought. We encountered a bear hunter early in the morning that told us he had spotted bear sign the day before and was back to continue the hunt. He also commented to us that this was the worst smelling bear he had ever tracked. By late morning he had his bear and we again spoke with him. I put my head in the canopy of his truck to look at the bear and did not notice any foul smell. My husband and I continued hunting for deer. We decided to split up. He dropped me off at an old overgrown road and was going to drive over to the one that ran parallell to it. The plan was for me to walk out slowly to the clear cut then go to the right and meet up with him. As I reached the edge of the clearcut, I stopped to scan for deer. I started from the right slowly looking to the left, nothing. As I stepped out of the cover of the brush to my left, about 100 yards away, underneath the branches of a fir tree and back against the trunk, I saw what looked exactly like the face of a big foot. Now I had never given much thought to these things but this looked so much like one that I froze in my tracks. I was so scared that it took me fifteen minutes to drop my pack, which I was carrying in my left hand, and pick up my binoculars that were hanging from my neck. I had to talk my self into moving. I told my self that it was probably a stump under the tree. I got my binoculars to my eyes and looked at it and it still looked exactly like the pictures you see that people draw. It looked like it was crouching down trying to hide from view underneath the branches. The tree was not big maybe 20 feet tall. It looked like it was staring right at me. I thought from the first that this thing was a threat to me. I knew nothing of them and was very afraid. Well, I finally decided I could get one shot off before it got to me, my rifle is a bolt action, and I'm not very fast on the draw; it didn't help that I was shaking like a leaf. If I made it to the end of the road, then I would be in sight of my husband, who is a very good shot. Keep in mind that this line of reasoning was the fear of the unknown. I came out to where I could see my husband and waved to him while walking fast to meet up with him. I told him that there was something under a tree that looked exactly like the sasquatch pictures. He asked if I wanted to go back and check it out, I said no. I was happy to be back in his company. It was late afternoon by this time and we decided to hunt the right end of the clear cut. He left me sitting against a dirt mound looking across the end of the clear cut. My husband went farther to the right on the next hillside so he could watch the same area. I didn't feel afraid because the truck was just down the road less than 25 yards and I would just go get in if anything happened. We were both watching the clear cut and it was almost too dark to shoot, when across the cut where the edge of the old growth timber was still standing came the the loudest howling, screaming carrying on that I have ever heard. My husband described it like the howling of a coyote having its legs wrenched off but far to loud for a coyote to make. I can only describe it as a wall of screaming and howling that came up from the valley floor and blanketed everything, there was no place that howling, screaming wasn't. I sat forward and thought what the heck is that. The sound was coming from in front of where my husband was hunting, we estimate this to be 400 yards. I stayed put but was straining to see what was screaming like that in the corner of the woods, which would be maybe 600 yards from my position. It seemed to be staying just inside the tree line so we couldn't see it. After about twelve minutes of this my husband stood up to leave. When he did the screaming abruptly ended, there was dead silence.....not a sound anywhere. He came back to where I was and we decided it was time to leave. We did not do any investigating of sasquatch until two years later when my husband and his relatives were hunting up at Rim Rock lake and had another encounter. When we started checking sasquatch noises on the internet that's when we heard again the howls and screams that we had heard in the foothills by the ocean. We also think that the bear hunter smelled a sasquatch not his bear. And that the thing under the tree probably was a sasquatch watching me. We now go out with cameras and tape recorders hoping for another encounter.\", \"location_details\": \"From Hwy 105 turn onto Smith Anderson Road.

We watched the fireworks, then I offered to drive her home. I don't know the township road, but it is off state Route 676. We parked for a while then drove on to where she was staying. On the way to the house she had fallen asleep with her head in my lap, so she didn't see a thing. As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet. On both sides of the road were fence and cornfields. Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line. I was stunned and didn't say a word and just kept driving along slowly looking at this thing. As I went by it just looked at me. I didn't have a clue what to do, so I kept going.

The witness described a daylight encounter with his son while spotting for deer on private land near the Olympic Mountains. He said he and his son took some photos of the approaching figure with a cellphone. Five BFRO Investigators went to the witness's home to interview him and see the photos.  We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color. --------------------------------- BFRO Investigator: What were the events that led up to this incident? Witness: We came down the road and turned around like usual and we go very slow down the end of the road. As we come down this road, probably at about 150 yards, maybe a little more out in the woods I could see something moving. I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy \\u201cWHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?\\u201d He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet. Stopped the truck and you could see a form coming. I call it a sasquatch. It kept coming. I said \\u201cLook at that!\\u201d He said \\u201cWhat is that??\\u201d \\u201cWell I don't know what the hell it is and I don't even have my camera.\\u201d Then he said \\u201cYou do too have a camera \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got your cellphone.\\u201d So I took the phone out and handed it to him. By the time he got the phone working that was when picture 1 was taken. It was about that time that it was fifty yards from us.  Then the next picture it was probably thirty yards, for picture 2, and then it turned to its left. BFRO Investigator: Was it aware of you at that point? Witness: It didn't act like it cared if we were there or not, other than it did turn. It was getting brushier between us and it and it turned, then went into an opening.  It came into the opening and then at one point it stopped and turned its head, looking right at us. Investigator: Did it turn its head or whole body? Witness: Well, the whole shoulder part - the front portion. It lifted its left shoulder back and twisted and looked at us. Then it just went right back into the angle it was. Investigator: When it looked at you, what was the expression on its face? Could you see any of that? Witness: I don't know.  It just looked at us. You know \\u2013 deer-in-the-headlights type of look. Investigator: Did it look surprised? Witness: It looked more like the same as we were, \\u201cWhat are you?  What the heck are you doing here?\\u201d   I was just looking at the size of it cause it was ... IT WAS HUGE. I kept asking him, \\u201cDID YOU GET A PICTURE???\\u201d You know, \\u201cDid you get a picture???\\u201d (Witness's son).. \\u201cI GOT A PICTURE THERE!\\u201d Then it just turned back and to the angle it was originally going. Then it picked up its stride. It moved a little faster probably half again as fast as it was going. Then he (the witness\\u2019s son) got out of the truck, the boy did. Then it paused, like it was going to turn again and look at us but it didn't. It just turned, I don't know if it went around something or what and he got one more picture. Then it came on the road and he couldn't get one more picture before he left. I don't know how long all that took. Investigator: So it cut across a logging road? Witness: The road runs through there. Investigator: And you lost it once it went across? Witness: It stepped right on the road and I don't think it made two steps.  The first step and then it was standing, stopped right there and it looked right at us. It was standing more upright. The next step it went into heavy brush - just a deer trail or a little path. The brush just closed in around it. I pulled forward and there is another little road that goes down along the way it went and we never did see it again. Investigator: You said it crossed the road, how many steps did it take to cross the road? Witness: One, two it was across because it just stepped in the road and stepped off it. It's a narrow road. It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet. Like when deer will jump, hit the road once when they are running. It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods. Investigator: Was there a trail on either side of the road? Witness: I didn't notice a trail where it came from as much as I noticed a trail from where it went. You know where it came from was bracken fern and salal brush. It's up there above my waist. Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains. Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal? Witness: About that tall.  Then it goes in stages but your base layer is at least that high. Investigator: So what we are seeing in these pictures is... ? Witness: Oh his butt was above the brush, it's chest height on me. [the witness is 6 feet tall] Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours. Witness: Don't think so, I don't think the hands were on the ground. Investigator: You don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s walking with its knuckles? Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't.   They were just kind of there. Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally? Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all. Investigator: So it is walking hunched over but not down on all fours? Witness: I didn't notice it being down on all fours. Investigator: Just looking at the angle the torso is in, leaning quite far forward - it would be very difficult to walk in that manner without falling over. Witness: Well I couldn\\u2019t do it.. Laugh.. Investigator: Yeah, that is interesting. Witness: I said it's not like he's crawling over logs or windfalls or anything either. He appears to be more hunched over in certain pictures than when he was walking towards us, but he was still hunched over coming towards us. I noticed as he was coming towards us that he walked from side to side. Investigator: He waddled? Witness: Yeah he swayed or something, like every step he would really make a big step,...you know like a little kid being proud or something... but I know, well you just need better pictures, you need to be there.. Investigator: You needed your video camera. Witness: [Laughing] Yeah - I wouldn't have had these if the kid hadn't remembered the camera on the phone. Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints? Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't.  The road is pretty hard.   It's all black crushed rock and that's hard as rock. There is nothing there where he came out of.  He didn\\u2019t leave as much of a trail as I thought he would coming through the bracken ferns and stuff. That's what I thought. It surprised me, because after he came through there I figured you'd see a trail, as even brush pickers and mushroom pickers coming through you can see they're leaving trails. You know breaking them away, and there wasn't one. It was hard to see where he came out on to the road vs where he went in. He went in on a regular old deer trail & where he came out, it was almost undisturbed. That surprised me as a matter of fact. Places I went in there I left more of a trail in the bracken ferns than he did. Investigator: What time of day was this? Witness: It had to be around 10:00, 10:30. Investigator: In the morning? Witness: Yeah Investigator: And it's on the 16th of November (2007). Witness: Yeah a week ago Friday Investigator: There weren't any other cars around? Witness: No, there was nobody else there. Not where we were at.

At night we all played games like glow in the dark dodgeball or went inside the cafeteria to play telephone or mystery date. Sometimes before bed we would go out and watch the bats dive bomb small rocks we tossed up into the air under the light above the back door. Another game we played at night up there is called \\\"Mission Impossible.\\\" The idea is that a camp counselor goes into the surrounding woods whitch are cordoned off and hides as best he can. Everyone else (kids and group leaders) goes to find this person so he can give you a slip that says you found him. If you are one of the first five back you get ice cream or cake, some prize of that sort. Meanwhile the other counselors are out with flashlights patrolling around looking for you. If you are spotted you have to go back to the cafeteria and start over. While I was out looking for the counselor I was hidden in the bushes next to the road leading to the cafeteria. Behind me was the baseball field. It was illuminated by a bright moon out that night. I had ducked into the bushes because two of the counselors who were searching walked right passed me. As I was crouched into the thick of the bushes I was motionless listening for anything that would tip me off to the whereabouts of anyone else. Thats when it struck me I couldent hear any of the regular sounds from the woods. No chirps, no animal rustling, none of the natural sounds I was used to hearing out there night after night. As I started looking around I heard a light shaking of bushes adjacent to me in the baseball sidelines. I'm crouched about 5 feet from first base and the bushes were moving over by third base. As I watched figuring I would see one of the counselors or another searcher come out of the bushes, something else did. It was huge. Myself, I am 6'4\\\" and leveled off this thing as it came out next to the fence whitch was 4 ft high. The fence came up to what I can only guess was its waist witch  I figure would put it about 8' to 8'5\\\" tall, gigantic shoulders and a thin waist like you would expect on a bodybuilder. I was dumbfounded and shocked, but not scared as it didnt seem to know where I was or that I was even there. It stepped out cautiously and took a few steps into the open to cross toward the outfield. About two steps into the field it crouched down and looked toward the road as a couple kids who got caught came around the bend and walked by me with thier backs to the baseball field. Then as they got farther away I looked back and it was on two feet and was moving in a flash. It was across the field in about 5-6 second and into the woods alongside the mountain. When it ran I could see its whipsy hair in the moonlight, but I couldent make out a color. After It left I emerged from the bushes and spent the last of the evening in the cafeteria. My mother who was a counselor said I must have been cold because I was white as a sheet. This was not a bear, deer, or elk. Looking back on a once in a lifetime chance I wish I would have gone and done something fool hardy like tried to walk out to it.

The creature was upright, approximately 4.5 to 5 feet tall, moved extremely fast on two legs, and was completely covered in hair.  What I will never forget is the visual sight of it running across the road and then, in one single, seemingly effortless bound, leaping completely across and clearing a livestock fence that was approximately 4 to 4.5 feet tall.

I went and reported it when it happened to the local police but they didn't make an official report because of the circumstances, this happened back in 1978. I was a teletype operator in the United States Air Force, I was a crypto guy, we monitored Russian and Chinese teletype. In 1978 I had just come out of tech school and went back home to Southern Illinois, where I was raised. The reason I found you was through some other guys website who had something to do with Southern Illinois University in Edwardwardville. I grew up in East St.Louis, which is four miles south of Monk's Mound, Cahokia Mound. I went home on leave in 1978, the fall of '78. I have a top secret clearance, in fact I went one above top secret my last year of the service overseas. So I was very leery of saying anything. I was just on my way up to visit a friend one morning, on home on leave, I had my dad's car, he's at work. I'm driving up to the campus, up on University Drive, and there is a little old church (St. Paul's United Church Of Christ) right there on the frontage road, right before you head up into the bluffs, into the university proper. I had driven down there, for some reason, just to see what was down there, I had never driven down there before. It was a kind of foggy morning, kind of misty and rainy, there is nothing behind this old church other than a bunch of hay fields, there were a bunch of hay rings where the guy had just drug through and done the hay thing.  I'm driving down the road, I was going to turn around in the grass behind the church and I see this bear way down on the dirt road and it is bent over splashing water in a puddle in the middle of the road. As I pull down closer to this thing, it's not a bear and it is huge. I bring my car within about ten yards of it and then veer off into the field, and get out with my door between me and the thing. And, it stands up and it's like eight or nine feet tall, it looked like a black humanoid. I grew up in Southern Illinois, I am a hunter, my dad was a hunter. I had a goose gun in the trunk. I get the gun out. Something in my head clicked and I'm thinking, of course there were all these stories about these things up by Alton, Illinois but I had never really heard anything about my area. But something in my head clicked, I remember hearing about bigfoot in California, and I thought \\\"This is one of those bigfoots and I am going to wound this thing and Barnum & Bailey here I come\\\". I shot off with this goose gun to the left of this thing, and it didn't move, and then I shot off to the right and it didn't move again. Something inside of me said \\\"You can't hurt this thing and if you try to hurt it, it is only going to hurt you.\\\" And with that it shrugged, what it looked like it's shoulders at me and it binged off into the woods that are just north of that road. And each one of its leaps, bings, jumps, whatever it was 15 to 20 feet at a time and it was gone. Well, I completely freaked out, I went into the local gas station and washed my face off, and I drove right into Edwardsville and to the Madison County Sheriff's office and there was an old time deputy, and he looked at me after I told him the whole thing and he said \\\"You know I would think you were crazy or on drugs if it weren't for the fact that I have heard this same story in the last couple of weeks, and three of them were from good friends of mine who were out hunting and saw the same thing you did. If I was you, knowing the kind of job you got and you're getting ready to do I wouldn't tell anybody about this for a long time, and you would be a lot better off.\\\" And that was probably the most sound advice I ever got, because if I had told somebody about this they would have jerked my clearance and messed me around in the Air Force.\", \"location_details\": \"From I-270 take Exit 9.

My neighbor sleeps with his bedroom windows open and hears it approaching in the middle of the night.  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!  He has night vision and just as soon as he gets outside, he hears the footsteps slowly moving away.  He never picked up anything on the nightvision.

I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the \\\"Camp 70\\\" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another \\\"road\\\" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it's stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it's body in an up and down motion. It would bend it's knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree's and moved to my left (the creature's right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it's stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it's track's, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn't feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to.

My first perception of this visual was with in one second met with confusion. I remember this objects gate was very strong making good time across a boulder garden section of riverbed. The easy going swing of the arms was so natural, so at home cruising with ease across boulders and rocks. So smooth, like walking on a sidewalk. The legs went far out to make big steps. As that first second of visual recognition happened, I noticed how there was no clue of clothes or shoes. What I originally thought was a trenchcoat quickly gave way to questions in the mind over the next micro seconds. There is no sleeve ending into hands, but a continuity of dark color all the way to the finger tips. Same thing with the feet area, no shoes!

After unpacking all our gear and getting camp set up we began to notice medium sized rocks (golf ball to baseball sized) flying into our camp.

We continued to have rock thrown into our camp until the next morning.  In addition, roughly ten times during the night we heard very loud screams coming from further down our side of the resevoir.  We were a little worried because we weren't sure who or what was screaming.  If we weren't so far from a town we would have called the police for fear that someone was being hurt.  We took turns keeping watch until morning because of the wierd stuff going on.  At daybreak we decided to cut our trip short and head home.

The moon was pretty full last night and it was cloudless, so visibility was pretty good.  Behind my new home, which sits on nearly two acres, is a large hill that descends on the other side to a partially wooded area in a canyon where deer are seen all the time.  The heavier, more dense forest starts less than a mile away, and in fact heads into the mountains. As we conversed in my driveway, the COMPLETE silence was broken by this god-awful howl/growl/moan that echoed the whole valley. The volume was overwhelming.  Immediately, my dog, as well as multiple dogs on the road, began barking and almost seemingly panicked.  Now please let me tell you that we get elk, deer, bear and mountain lion around here pretty consistently, but never any reaction from the dogs like this. We went behind my house where my dog was no longer barking, but instead just shivering and looking up at the hill - just as 'it' did it again.  The sound is so incredibly similar to the 'howl' you have on your site that it is eerie. A third series of growls (and let me tell you they were deep and extremely loud) soared across our neighborhood. I let my dog have refuge in his fenced kennel where he retreated to his doghouse.  My dog is a year old lab who has grown up exposed to many wild animals. We waited but the noise finally stopped after 1-2 minutes.  We both commented on how the hair on the back of our necks were sticking up and that neither of us had heard ANYTHING like that before in all our years.

Since then, this location has been the site of an on-going investigation with a long-term audio recorder left in the woods near his house. I interviewed the witness again in late October 2011, and the content of the two interviews follows: The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - When was the first time something happened that you didn\\u2019t understand. Tom \\u2013 It was a year ago, so it was probably early June of 2010. It was a Saturday, a friend had stopped by. When I am outside my dog Lulu roams the property, sometimes she will go back into the tree-line but she usually stays close to me. At one o\\u2019clock in the afternoon we were in the shop talking and doing stuff. When he was getting ready to leave I called for her. She was real nervous, her tail was tucked. There was a light breeze from the south and she was facing towards the south and acting very unusual. Tom - I figured it was a deer, a coyote, something back there. I walked back a little ways and she wouldn\\u2019t move, she just stayed here by the side door, very nervous. I finally said, let\\u2019s go in. My friend had left. I opened the door and had to raise my voice to get her to come in, which was unusual because she always wants to stay right near me. So I raised my voice and she came in and she ran straight down the steps into the basement and hid. I first thought when she went down that she was looking for a toy or something. After ten minutes I went down and found her, she was hiding behind the furniture in an unused room, cowering, and I reached down and she wouldn\\u2019t come to me. I reached down to touch her and she was shaking. Tom - I made her come back up for awhile and then we went back outside and repeated the same thing five or six times to about  8 o\\u2019clock that night. We had Lady Asian bugs and I am apparently sinus sensitive to them and that night around 9 o\\u2019clock I got my sinuses cleared up and we stepped out that side door, still had a breeze from the south, and she instantly panicked and went into that cowering motion, still shaking and standing low, not up like a dog does. Tom - I stood there and thought about it for a little bit and got a good whiff of it. The best description I have is that it was like the worst locker room stench or sweaty clothes that sat in a hamper for two weeks mixed with maybe road kill, bloody violent. It stood the hair up on my back. I sat back and thought wow, the trees are two hundred feet away, what is back there that smells so bad. And at the time she laid down in the yard, facing the south and was real nervous. She would look over her should behind her and then she would get up and face the other way because the wind currents were changing and she kept doing that. So we went back in for the night. Tom - Next morning I got up and went to church and breakfast, came home, got dressed and walked back in there. She walked with for a ways and then she turned and ran back up here to the house. Tom \\u2013 From that time on there have been few deer and coyotes around. Prior to that I could see deer most every morning out back or down the roads. I think I have only seen one deer on my property in a year. Last night was the second time I\\u2019ve heard coyotes in a year. And usually if I grilled chicken out they would be howling, they would smell it and they\\u2019d be singing. Stan \\u2013 After that initial time did you smell it again last year? Tom \\u2013 I never noticed it again. About a week before, my nephew called and said there are footprints in a subdivision south of Chatham. I said that bugs me because a few days ago she (Lulu) was out back behind the brown shed barking in defense and I stepped out to see what she was doing. She had her nose up, she was following the wind currents I think, because she was running in circles, tail was tucked and she was real nervous. And I called her and she looked towards me, like she was ready to come to me and then she would jump like something spooked her, an animal, like you through a rock at her.  She did that for a couple of days when we were out. It was in the west that time and she was facing west. Stan \\u2013 Have you ever felt like you were being watched? Tom \\u2013  Yes, just about every time I see her doing something like that, a few times I\\u2019ve been outside, I get that feeling. Stan \\u2013 Have you ever had anything thrown at you, like rocks or anything. Tom \\u2013 No. Stan \\u2013 What about sounds? Tom \\u2013 Last night, it was probably after 10, I think it was 10:30 or so I had been watching TV and I noticed she was restless in the house. I asked her once \\u201cDo you have to go potty?\\u201d Usually she would come up to me and she would give me a \\u201cRuff\\u201d and we would go. She wouldn\\u2019t do that last night, she just looked at me like \\u201ckeep guessing\\u201d. About 10:30 I said \\u201cCome on let\\u2019s go potty and then we\\u2019ll go to bed. We stepped outside and she immediately faced south and froze and I got the feeling while she was doing that that somebody was starring at me. Tom \\u2013 So I stepped back in, grabbed my cellphone and my big spotlight and she was still outside. I stepped outside and started walking south towards the treeline, but she stayed right by that door. Now normally a dog will follow its master, and I got about half way between the pool and the treeline and stopped and stood there a little bit. And I could hear (it was real quiet you could hear crickets) stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp. My hair stood up, I thought \\u201cWhat in the world is walking in twigs and branches?\\u201d And I said \\u201cWho\\u2019s there?\\u201d and I stopped, and I\\u2019m thinking \\u201ca couple of my friends know and are they pulling a prank?\\u201d And then I think I said it again \\u201cWho\\u2019s there?\\u201d like that. Tom \\u2013 And I waited and there was a \\u201cWhoo-oo\\u201d sound like that came back at me, probably not that loud because it knew I could hear it whatever it was. Right after that, west of here, and I would say a good half mile coyotes started screaming and yelling. Now, I don\\u2019t need to be out here alone, I don\\u2019t have a gun, I don\\u2019t have a knife. My dog was spooked, she was staying up at the house. So, I came back in, started turning the light off, fifteen, twenty minutes passed. Tom \\u2013 I have a little sound amplifier and headset and you can adjust the volume. I went quietly out onto the deck, left her inside, and I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes listening. I could hear some footsteps same interval steps that was west of me now back in the trees. I said \\u201cThere is something back there, but I\\u2019m not going to go look after dark not when it\\u2019s something powerful. Tom \\u2013 Anyway when I came in from that I went to check email and Facebook was up with the link for Chatham for the story they just published in the paper about footprints and Messing With Sasquatch. Stan \\u2013 So did you hear any other vocals. Tom \\u2013 After I heard the footsteps and I called out and it made the sound back I started walking back up to the house. I heard what sounded like children playing and they weren\\u2019t very far away, like a couple of little girls giggling or talking. Now there are no kids back there, I know there can\\u2019t be. The next house is a half mile down the road or so. My dog Lu, started out to me and I said \\u201cWho is that?\\u201d and she froze and came right back to the house when she heard it again. Stan \\u2013 So it sounded like kids playing? Tom \\u2013 Like little girls talking or playing. Stan \\u2013 No crying, more as a conversation? Tom \\u2013 I don\\u2019t know how I would describe it, it wasn\\u2019t understandable, it wasn\\u2019t \\u201cI want that toy.\\u201d It was a whining, high pitched voice like a little girls would be. Stan \\u2013 Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom \\u2013 You are welcome Stan. On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the witness had an unusual experience at his home and the next morning found a large footprint outside his living room window. He took pictures with a tape measure along the footprint. Tom was also able to see all the toes in the loose dirt. But it's always difficult for photographs of footprints to show very much detail. My interview with Tom concerning this incident follows: Tom \\u2013 I have an L-shaped couch and I am sitting on one end of it, the other end is under a window, and that window is on the east side of my house. We are watching the World Series, it was probably around 9:30 and Lulu, my dog, raised her head and then looked at me with big eyes like \\u201cDid you hear that?\\u201d And then she turns and looks at the window and I go \\u201cYeah, I heard it.\\u201d And I said \\u201cGo ahead and get down.\\u201d So she got down, came out on the floor and laid down so she could watch the window. Tom \\u2013 And we heard the noise several more times, and she got up wandered around the house and smelled floor, and walls and was just nervous. Tom \\u2013 Then the next morning we went outside and there was a footprint out there. Now let me back up a little bit, Friday I pulled some rose bushes and raked the landscaping right there next to the house, so it was all fresh. So, that footprint happened I believe Sunday night. Now this scenario where she is on the couch and we hear this noise, this has happened seven or eight different times this summer. Stan \\u2013 Can you describe the sound. Tom \\u2013 It just sounds like a creak, like somebody is leaning against the wall on the outside. And I\\u2019ve got vertical blinds and they\\u2019re turned to block the light where I am sitting but when you are outside you can look and see the TV if you are tall. I can\\u2019t see the TV when I am outside. I am six foot tall. So for someone to look in that window has to be more than six foot tall. Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a length of 14 inches. Stan \\u2013 I know you had a ruler next to the footprint, how long did you think it was? Tom \\u2013 It is 14 inches long. Stan \\u2013 And the width was? Tom \\u2013 7 inches wide. And the footprint is curved, it almost looks like a broken foot or something, I don\\u2019t know how to describe it, but it\\u2019s not straight like ours. Where ours has an arch this looks like the footprint is curved. Stan \\u2013 Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom \\u2013 You are welcome Stan.

We went for a hike and got back to the campsite. There were numerous range cattle in our area. After hanging out at our site we heard a strange howl yell down in the creek bed the sound repeated 2 or 3 times, we were about 40 feet above the creek bed, we went down to take a look, we thought that an animal had injured itself. We found a young cow on the other side of the cattle guard. We opened the barb wire fence and tried to herd it to the other side, but it wouldn't go. We put the fence back up and went back to our camp. That night I woke up many times, thought I heard something and tried to see if anything was there in the full moon light illuminated meadows and forests. Our dog didn't react so I fell back to sleep hoping for morning. We woke up to some howls down in the creek bed below us. We had a video camera and tried to catch some of the howls on tape. We got 5 clips with the howls as they moved further away. I will email the best one after I submit this report. We tried to follow the sound away from us but it moved too fast, and our son was still sleeping in our campervan. We went back to camp and didn't hear or see anything else. We went to a bakery in Okanogan, WA and told of our experience and explained where we camped and all three people working said they had heard of this kind of activity around where we were. I have spent a lot of time in the woods and wild places, don't hunt or fish, and have never heard this kind of sound before.

My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The \\\"whispering\\\" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier.
