Don't go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn & rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they  
Don't go gentle into that good night.  

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

Wild men who caught & sang the sun in flight,  
& learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  
Don't go gentle into that good night.  

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors & be gay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

& you, my father, there on the sad height,  
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Don't go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  

â€” _Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953_
