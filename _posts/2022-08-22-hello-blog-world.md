This is me writing an intro to this blog post. So introlicioius.

## 1. Here's 1 thing I want to say

This is maybe an important thing, &, at the very least it's 1st.

## 2. Another Thing

I'm now talking about a 2nd thing, probably also good.

## 3. A 3rd Thing

We're now getting into the weeds of things I'm saying. It's probably unlikely someone has made it thus far.

## 4. Thing #4.

At this point, you're probably no longer into me listing off things. Let's put in an image to placate the reader:

## 5. The Last Thing

This is my final thing, probably would be great if this was a TL;DR or summary. But I don't have that for you. I've given you so little already, why start saying anything useful now?

Besides, all anybody wants is a certificate:
